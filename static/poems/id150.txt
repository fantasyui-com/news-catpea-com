Authenticy

While not everything can be planned,<br>
authenticity and learning go hand in hand.

Some lessons can get pretty tough,<br>
but will fix us, sure enough.

When life gets sad or feel no good,<br>
it may be something you misunderstood.

And our views will shift,<br>
and we'll convert that bad into a gift.

<br><br>

Pretenders, can't learn this way,<br>
always in the dark, be it night or day.

They walk an alien path,<br>
darkness and wrath.

There is nothing there to fix,<br>
it's all an incomprehensible mix.

<br><br>

To live on a spectrum opposite of devious,<br>
makes each day connect with the previous,

And as days add up, they make you stronger,<br>
and your steps travel even longer.

Each day turns into a gifts and rewards,<br>
you stop being played, and create your own chords.

<br><br>

Authenticity is a superpower,<br>
it will help you rise, and you'll never cower.

Day after day you become more powerful,<br>
this is how we become truly beautiful.

It will help you finish what you start,<br>
and your life, will become, a work of art.
