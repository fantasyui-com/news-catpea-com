Amazing Diet

Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Eight,
My salads are working great!

I have lost even more weight,
and I can't even count how many I ate.

It is a marvelous diet of incredible proportions,
I don't track my calories, or even my portions.

I just make a salad once or twice,
and with strawberry jam, it tastes like paradise.

And yes, I still continue improving and experimenting,
Today, I added Jalapenos for a little spicy augmenting.

It is a strange magical thing,
but Sugary Jam and Jalapenos are king.

It is not all sugar and spice, as yesterday I cried,
I added and ate an whole onion so angry, I almost died.

So it is not just strawberry jam anymore,
blueberry works just as well, maybe even more.

To all the diet people out there,
join me in my venture,
add a spoon jam,
and taste the adventure.
