And because it was a Component that stored a bunch of logic, I wasn&#39;t able to say: &quot;Hey! when you change, then reset the current message timeout too.&quot; Without being able to say that, If a Body Building Advice is set to display for 2 minutes, and I change that to 1 second, it will take two minutes for that change to take place.</p>\n<p>It would take no effort at all without Components, with components, I end up hoisting all kinds of optional eventualities for edge cases like this one.</p>\n<p>There were multiple obstructions in the way.</p>\n<p>Even on the graphic level. Bootstrap&#39;s Tab bar uses a background trick, that demands I set a background for a tab, so it can hide the selected tab bottom-border. They should not be using a trick, if tabs are not possible without CSS/HTML trick, then they should not be shipped.</p>\n<p>In Svelte they would not allow me to do Svelte things on Components I created.</p>\n<p>For example, I cannot say this button should be sent to a template slot named menu, it trows: &quot;&#39;slot&#39; is reserved for future use in named slots&quot;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I could not apply a conditional class on a Custom component as it would throw: &quot;Classes can only be applied to DOM elements, not components&quot;</p>\n<p>So, I cannot create general purpose custom Bootstrap components.</p>\n<p>I had a weird feeling about it from the beginning.</p>\n<p>So now, I cannot create Custom Stores, I cannot create Custom Components.</p>\n<p>Fair enough. The custom stuff is not part of the Svelte magic, and it is secondary on their todo list.</p>\n<p>And I need to stick to what Bootstrap and Svelte are good at, and stop trying to twist/generalize things.</p>\n<p>One example of me quietly twisting things is the card/app caption on the catpea.com homepage/dashboard it is a label and a button but not the Bootstrap way. Bootstrap&#39;s way would be either the tabs, or pill buttons, the first button would be the title, and second the little preferences icon.</p>\n<p>CSS/HTML, Bootstrap/Svelte are not moving in a direction where code complexity can be squished.</p>\n<p>I think that should be a meta-programming layer on top, layer I make with Sweet.</p>\n<p>But even with a large meta-programming effort, I end up with this initial hoisting problem where edge cases cause a need to hoist optional things up top, they never get used but they do create a lot of code liability.</p>\n<p>So, what I am left with here, is... that each app should be its own word, and should not demand any reusable Components.</p>\n<p>This way, there are no obstructions, just open code, but it is hard to read code.</p>\n<p>This is yet again a vote for a Visual Programming Language, where things are not divided into well defined components, but generally reusable snippets.</p>\n<p>For now though, I&#39;ll keep things simple, and simplify the apps I have thus far wrote, rather than create Components out of them.</p>\n"

With the simple syntax, I rewrote time-ago (ex: Updated 1 hour ago) everywhere, including categories, which track time of the latest post, there is category layer above that that stores that time, it is like a double update:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I first scan the database updating the ago text for each post.</li>\n<li>I make a category database, and update that when cost ago stamps change.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While I was doing this, it occurred to me that I should use a top down component model. Meaning, data lives on top, all the changes happen to it on top, and then data cascades down into all the pages, and then, page components.</p>\n<p>Normally, that&#39;s how applications are made. But Cat Pea News, is not just Svelte, it is also Sapper a static file server...</p>\n<p>And of course the point being, that no JavaScript is needed to read news.</p>\n<p>So, google can index my content archive.org can mirror my content, and they don&#39;t need to execute my JavaScript.</p>\n<p>It is just the principle alone: If a website is not a Dynamic Application, it should not require JavaScript for operations.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned yesterday, the time ago feature of posts is disabled in a no JavaScript environment, and friendly Date appears.</p>\n<p>My demand for a Non-JavaScript website, and my use of Sapper, skewed my research into Svelte.</p>\n<p>I am not ready to complain about it yet.</p>\n<p>Cat Pea News is too unique.</p>\n<p>The fancy thing is, I learned a lot about Svelte, yeah, so when I come back to dynamic applications NO CUSTOM STORES (custom memory/database work) because that does not get equal treatment under svelte and forces special syntax, and cascading requirements.</p>\n<p>It appears that Custom Svelte Stores are my only real problem. If use the Top Down application architecture, then I don&#39;t have that problem.</p>\n<p>Svelte Sapper is best for applications, and it is better than everything else for static websites.</p>\n<p>This is still the best in everything, but it is not the Perfect Compiler I expected.</p>\n<p>It helped me define my expectations as well.</p>\n<p>I want reactive data, reactive CSS, reactive HTML, and I want it all to keep to JavaScript, XML (HTML), CSS conventions.</p>\n<p>These parts are so complex, that their interaction would require months of research.</p>\n<p>It is amazing how many clever ideas span the <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a>, <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a>, <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue</a> and <a href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular</a> universe.</p>\n<p>Maybe, the correct solution to Applications/Websites is not all code. But it will require Visual Programming Tools. With another abstraction layer over a programming language, the gravity of code duplication, meta-programming, documentation, maintenance shifts and may a allow a perfect programming language, but that is far and different universe, it has nothing to do with Svelte.</p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that I looked at <a href=\"https://www.sweetjs.org/\">Sweet.js</a> this morning, as I sometimes do. It is meta-programming or super-programming for JavaScript, and I was able to define one property of a proper language: LOW CODE DENSITY. This means that the language is suited for the task at hand and need not be twisted. Custom Stores in Svelte cause twisting:</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/t-1.png\" alt=\"research/t-1.png\"></p>\n<p>In React, a three line example is enough to show twisting:</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/t-2.png\" alt=\"research/t-3.png\"></p>\n<p>With meta-programming, with super-programming that code can reduced to a single clean statement. And meta-programming will work for all languages. Svelte uses meta-programming, the layer for custom stores is just not complete, or or is meant to be more flexible.</p>\n<p>Maybe, Low Code Density, or Untwisted Code can only be achieved on per project basis, and only with meta-programming.</p>\n<p>After all Svelte&#39;s Might is the Meta Programming setup.</p>\n<p>I a glad I mention <a href=\"https://www.sweetjs.org/\">Sweet.js</a> here.</p>\n<p>Then there is the question of HTML vs Flex/Swing, or question of Containers and Components like old <a href=\"https://dojotoolkit.org/\">Dojo</a> is/was <a href=\"https://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.10/dijit_layout/\">doing</a>.\nA high level nestable container framework would cut down on UI code considerably. Combination of Meta Programming (to obscure reactive boilerplate) and Components/Containers could potentially create a Rapid Application Development platform with code worth reading. A sane Visual Programming Environment on top of that, could really speed up large application development.</p>\n<p>Back to Applications, and goodness I need to make a Raspberry Lettuce Salad for lunch.</p>\n"

It will quickly become a long document with useful little recipes for UI building.</p>\n"

Moreover, Svelte already compiles to WebComponents, and WebComponents will forever lack (by default) a good automatic data to UI updates, because they are not designed to make programming reasonable, unlike Svelte.</p>\n<p>These important Theme-Extras therefore, must be written in Svelte. And Cat Pea, is a prime example of what an Extra would look like. All those little boxes, little menus, little drawers, bits of Music Making, Bodybuilding Advice, all of that are snippets of code that will make this theme sell. The news site, is not a good snippet, it should be included, but it is too monolithic, it is just buttons for browsing posts.</p>\n<p>I will need to redesign Cat Pea with that in mind, so my programming adventure is also making a tiny product for <a href=\"https://themes.getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap Themes</a>. Anyhow, here are the newly added UI improvements.</p>\n<p>Here is the new Home Page, it looks like an App, because the user is browsing All Posts at first.\nI think it would be better to create a Home Page that first opens to 5 latest posts, and I may do that later.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/news-update-1.png\" alt=\"Updates\"></p>\n<p>This is Category View, it is a lot cleaner, but it is very busy. I basically turned 3 words (Research, Quarantine, Theme) into a web page, but this is probably more sustainable as far as writing a lot of articles goes.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/news-update-2.png\" alt=\"Updates\"></p>\n<p>And this is what reading a post looks like now. I&#39;ll have toggle tat off into a mini miniature, I&#39;d like to see just the post here, I&#39;ll add a &quot;Quick Nav&quot; box and when that&#39;s opened the quick navigation features will show up. Reading a post should just be about a post.</p>\n<p>I like the Listen button, and I like the fact that it fits well on the home page.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/news-update-3.png\" alt=\"Updates\"></p>\n<p>The one big change is that there is no more Player, the user has to click the button to see it. This is because every browser has it&#39;s own player. The stablest method is to add the button that just links to the mp3 file.</p>\n<p>I also setup an external repository for my writing over on <a href=\"https://github.com/fantasyui-com/news\">Github</a> it is not easy to navigate, but if I ever lose catpea.com domain name, or github is down, or technology changes, there is always this external master that has all the text and poems and my <a href=\"https://github.com/fantasyui-com/news/tree/master/poems\">recordings</a> mostly accessible. I want the 70 year old me, to be able to access this and be really embarrassed and filled of regret about how he wasn&#39;t a serious person when he had a chance. The heck with that guy.</p>\n"

After the code is in Bootstrap, it takes one line to use it.</p>\n<p>Here is what the Sass code for one of the presets (Energon) in <a href=\"/designer\">Designer</a> looks like:</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/energon2.png\" alt=\"Energon: Installation\"></p>\n<p>Energon: Installation</p>\n<p>And here is what it takes to use it in some design:</p>\n<p>(.card.energon means a card that has been marked as being of type energon, and a card is the boxes I use on the homepage.

I am exporting information to multiple programming languages, JavaScript, CSS, and Sass. And in the case of Sass, I need to pass CONFIGURATION VARIABLES so that the customers can tweak them. I can&#39;t calculate the colors at all. That means, the Math for CSS and JavaScript has to match the Math for Scss.</p>\n<p>This is Applied Color Theory...</p>\n<p>I used calculations over <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAw2_NtGNaA\">HSL</a> for all three (CSS, JavaScript, and Sass) and it worked. For example Saturation of 0.5 in JavaScript, means the same thing that Saturation of 0.5 in Sass. But they each have a different way of expressing that. In JavaScript I say &#39;*&#39;+(0.5+1), and in Sass I have to say ((0.5*100 )/2).toFixed(1)</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/energon.png\" alt=\"Energon Cubes: Crazy Design\"></p>\n<p>Energon Cubes: Crazy Design</p>\n<p>And when all is said and done Compiled <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com\">Sass</a> and <a href=\"/designer\">Designer</a> preview, match pixel for pixel, because of my use of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAw2_NtGNaA\">HSL</a> Color Model. The code for both is written by different programmer for different languages.</p>\n<p>And there is no way a person will get far, without some visual tool like the <a href=\"/designer\">Designer</a>.</p>\n<p>Manipulating colors is such a freaking delicate operation, a 5% difference in Saturation and Brightness can either make a design, or make it look off and crappy.</p>\n<p>There is no creating something like the Energon Experiment with a visual preview. Something as silly and useless as Energon required four separate revisions, to adjust blur/spread and colors, and the base color. It is just not possible without a tool.</p>\n<p>A lot of Programmers/Designers use the browser as it has some preview/editing features.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/bp.png\" alt=\"Browser Can&#39;t help with Sass SCSS for Bootstrap\"></p>\n<p>Browser Can&#39;t help with Sass SCSS for Bootstrap</p>\n<p>But how the heckedy heck to declare/extract variables, and generate Sass&#39;s SCSS code, that&#39;s not possible in the browser - lyke at all.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/calc.png\" alt=\"Still doing math in Sass\"></p>\n<p>Still doing math in Sass</p>\n<p>The code in Sass is still going to do some math based on the settings.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/setings.png\" alt=\"User&#39;s Settings\"></p>\n<p>User&#39;s Settings</p>\n<p>And the settings exists so that the user/customer can tweak things, they aren&#39;t really interested in building a new design, just making a slight alteration that makes sense in their business context.</p>\n<p>One such example is removing the top-right highlight, or darkening the bottom-most blur/drop shadow to match their webpage-background.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/box4.png\" alt=\"View of the different things at play.\"></p>\n<p>View of the different things at play.</p>\n<p>Now I need to make some serious presets that will get me closer to a more serious design:</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/real.jpg\" alt=\"Serious Design\"></p>\n<p>Serious Design</p>\n"

I should do what is possible to do, with a hefty dose of code integrity, and program stability.</p>\n<p>More than that, my theme, my designs, should apply to many versions of Bootstrap, many of the <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/versions/\">past releases</a> - that&#39;s just good programming.</p>\n<p>Even if I stick to the v4.x branch (which is most reasonable), I will need to release 5 of 6 versions of my theme, and then maybe three more after that.</p>\n<p>I am very well aware, what a punch in the stomach all this is to the designers. The stuff that I am working on here, is really uncomfortable for most Designers. They don&#39;t want to process abstract syntax trees, or learn programming even.</p>\n<p>Also, a little twinkle of a business perspective is bubbling up here. Automated processing means bug free product, fast upgrades, fast support.</p>\n<p>But still, I am not sure what I will do to automate Design, once I do have SuperNavbar, presumably with all colors removed, and I make some classes like I have in <a href=\"/theme\">Theme</a> right now, to apply color to things, an interactive color, that supports mult-color-websites and multiple dark themes.</p>\n<p>Vary some fonts, and padding, and margins. I am still stuck with, what is basically... a <a href=\"https://bootswatch.com/\">basic theme</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/basic.png\" alt=\"Basic Theme\"></p>\n<p>Basic Theme</p>\n<p>I still have to come up with a Robotic Artist, that actually does <a href=\"http://pixelkit.com/kits/gui/\">real design</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/real.jpg\" alt=\"Real Design\"></p>\n<p>Real Design</p>\n<p>But...

Art is actually easy. I don&#39;t think anyone should ever sit down to decorating Navbars, the decorations must be carbon copied from something simpler, and certainly more reusable. THis way multiple components can be decorated at once.</p>\n<p>Wow, it is 2PM already. I am thinking about a lot of my programming projects at once, this coloring adventure is just relaxations.</p>\n"

I am using a system here that takes a snapshot of the code, and uploads that snapshot to catpea.com, that snapshot is shown to you before the real code loads. This helps the search engines process data, it improves load times by a huge amount. When I generate a website at noon, it will be bright, when I generate it at night it will be dark, this introduces complexity to something as silly as night mode. I just have the night mode run in manual now. By default the website is bright, and if the user clicks the light bulb it will switch to dark.</p>\n<p>It is a fun problem, it actually asks for User Preferences, where the user can put website coloring in manual.</p>\n<p>There is a technological problem lingering here, unfortunately. I can only animate transitions to dark. The system us unable to smoothly transition back to bright. This is a problem with <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a>&#39;s color information. Colors are so different from layout, that they should live in their own file, with their own programming. In Bootstrap 4.5.x this is not the case, and the code is ugly. In 5.0 they maybe fixing this (I am guessing), but it will forever be their solution, and they are unlikely to focus on nice to haves like smooth animations between color modes</p>\n<p>I need to take over <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a>&#39;s Colors. This is not easy. But I&#39;ve done it before. I nuked all the color declarations and automatically built a separate color file. It was a sophisticated, but primitive experiment. But automatic color declaration removal is critical, as Bootstrap changes their code all the time. With each new version I have to revise my code, that&#39;s not cool. With automatic processing, that will be much easier.</p>\n<p>See, coloring is not just about making a pretty scheme, it is a hard problem, and it requires hard programming, like parsing the SCSS code-base, deleting declarations in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), then dumping it back into a mere bootstrap.scss file. Then programming a general purpose coloring system capable of accounting for all the missing colors. I am going to leave this for later, automated processing is never without problems. Goodness knows, Bootstrap is trying to keep the colors kind of outside of the main coed base, but the functions that apply colors are still un-uniform and deeply burred.</p>\n<p>To be realistic about what can be achieved in the <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> 4.0.x - 5.0 realm, I think I can only change the HUE, I can go from their blue to Orange, but I can&#39;t make the orange too dark, or too bright. This still solves the coloring problem, it is an extremely simple and effective solution</p>\n<p>There is yet another way of looking at color, and that is seeing it in relation to how readability is impacted. It would be possible to go from White-on-Blue to White-on-Yellow, so as long as I carefully calculated <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html\">wcag-contrast</a>, and altered the yellow to be within the same (or similar) range as blue.</p>\n<p>Playing with color now.</p>\n"

Enough so that text in red on red-25 background will be guaranteed to be readable.</p>\n<p>If this does not work out, then I&#39;ll create an extended palette of all colors and just name them red-dark and red-light.</p>\n<p>And if this fails, then the only two colors the user will get to keep will be Primary and Secondary, everything else will be strictly computer generated.

A dark website will use bg-dark for all the widgets, and a white website will use bg-light. There isn&#39;t really a way to flip-flop between the two without human intervention.

Each cell in here represents about 16 notes that can be inserted. But also, once the user establishes those 16 notes, they only need to worry about lighting those buttons up, it is always the same 16 notes per row... they just select where those notes are active. And beneath this grid is a list of instruments, and places where those 16 notes go. If the user places sharp-drums as the first instruments, selects all 16 note-spots, then it will play tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk BUT ONLY IF THE cell in the thing pictured above is lit. So this grid is an activator of melodies.

So when two of bootstrap colors start biting each other for example button and box (that the button is in) I can make the button lighter by saying button color: primary-color-light, so I tripled color count, in such a way that all the users of the <a href=\"/theme\">Theme</a> just need to remember &quot;Oh, yeah, all the colors have a dark and light variation now. Hmm.&quot; so <a href=\"/daw\">CATPEA DAW</a> UI is back to semi-normal now, and I updated the <a href=\"/theme\">Theme</a> page to show off this upgrade.</p>\n"

I switched from <a href=\"https://github.com/sass/node-sass\">node-sass</a> to <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com\">Sass</a>, node-sass got old, I guess.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#39;t really paying too much attention to SASS (a UI programming language) because I think CSS should be shaped with JS, as these are native browser</p>\n<p>technologies. But since <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> is forcing me into <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com\">Sass</a>, I might as well make use of the language, and... I guess its functions as well.</p>\n<p>Since this is a new addition to the system, there is both a learning curve, and bugs.</p>\n<p>So I&#39;ve been trying to execute color.adjust(#6b717f, $red: 15); these are the big fancy new functions, but I&#39;ve been getting errors for days.</p>\n<p>Well, now that I switched to <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com\">Sass</a> (from node-sass) there were changes, but I still got an error.</p>\n<p>It turns out they have a new module system, and before I make use of the color function I have to execute @use &#39;sass:color&#39;; on top of the program file.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s how it is done in all programming languages, but since I upgraded, I had to learn few new things about the new version of the language.</p>\n<p>Now, this does not mean that I approve of the existence of the <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if\">SASS Programming Language</a> in my code. But it is OK.</p>\n<p>As the first, thing here, I created a custom function, this is written in JavaScript, and it is integrated with SASS. The function measures readability between a background color and a foreground color, and it is interesting... Because even though everyone says &quot;if readability is more than 4.5 you are peachy&quot;,</p>\n<p>When working with themes, when kind of knowing colors, the 4.5 threshold can be lowered down to 1.5 even.</p>\n<p>The big deal here is being able to say, keep darkening/lightening that color until it passes the readability test.</p>\n<p>Here is an image of a recent test of using my <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html\">wcag-contrast</a>(foreground, background) function until a color is readable.</p>\n<p>Note how text in the first column it not readable as the background and text-color converge in the middle.</p>\n<p>And now look at the second column, where SMART coloring is taking place.</p>\n<p>I know it is still dark, I kept the color change threshold very low on purpose, to make the overall UI graphics nice. The point is that the text is keeping up with the background, it is keeping juuuuuuust a wee bit above, un-readability.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/smart-color.png\" alt=\"GUI Ideas\"></p>\n<p>Automatic Coloring</p>\n<p>As a side-note, programming-wise this is not really impressive, it is like 5 lines of code, so pro-programmers would yawn at this, but it is a big deal for me, because I am getting really precise and delicate control over colors in my Dark Theme here, that it is only 5 lines of code, is great for me, I can just type in a bit of code and be done with worrying about color readability for some UI component or button/label combo. I like this. And I like being given the opportunity to ponder if I want something to grow brighter (like a label on a button) or darker, like in the case of a number-label on a table of data (like a row number in Excel).</p>\n"

I am learning to make components for <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> this has been a hobby of mine for many years now. It feels nice to be making progress here. I still need to create a configuration section that stores all the sizing/color information, with descriptions and such. The <a href=\"https://github.com/fantasyui-com/catpea-com/tree/master/src/style/drawer\">drawer page</a> shows examples of how to use the Drawer, that language is called HTML. <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> developers would frown on my work thus far because the drawer component can almost be made in another way, they actually have similar things. But I am thinking about creating components for a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Digital+Audio+Workstation&amp;tbm=isch\">Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)</a> like <a href=\"https://www.ableton.com/en/live/\">Ableton</a>, right now the drawer is not impressive, but it will evolve beyond what Bootstrap can do. Already I am thinking that I should not use colors, but rather transparent shadows, so whatever color is in the background the drawer will inherit it automatically. <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> creates flat/raised things, and my additions may end up being graphically sunken. Plus, <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> creates structure, and I use it for layout and containers. They don&#39;t really create content that is specific for some purpose (like my DAW), they limit themselves to general purpose things. They do sell themes, and if I ever completed this project, they may accept mine into their store. I have much more to learn, and I still have to get used to their way of doing things.</p>\n"

This reshapes the Synthesized Sounds, the synthesizer waveform, into a more realistic sounding instrument. Reverb just about does it, if Commodore 64 came with a decent reverb it would sound amazing, nothing like chiptunes. I have gotten used to breaking up my Generative Music into movements, and the initial song comes with 24 measures, where evey eight measures I do something interesting with the higher pitched instruments. For the most part I fell like using A Basic <a href=\"https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki/Arpeggiator\">Arpeggiator</a> for everything, I am yet to test it with real world sound samples (digital sound recordings as opposed to synthesizer based sounds.)</p>\n"
