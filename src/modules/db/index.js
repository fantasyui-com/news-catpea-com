After the code is in Bootstrap, it takes one line to use it.</p>\n<p>Here is what the Sass code for one of the presets (Energon) in <a href=\"/designer\">Designer</a> looks like:</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/energon2.png\" alt=\"Energon: Installation\"></p>\n<p>Energon: Installation</p>\n<p>And here is what it takes to use it in some design:</p>\n<p>(.card.energon means a card that has been marked as being of type energon, and a card is the boxes I use on the homepage.

I am exporting information to multiple programming languages, JavaScript, CSS, and Sass. And in the case of Sass, I need to pass CONFIGURATION VARIABLES so that the customers can tweak them. I can&#39;t calculate the colors at all. That means, the Math for CSS and JavaScript has to match the Math for Scss.</p>\n<p>This is Applied Color Theory...</p>\n<p>I used calculations over <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAw2_NtGNaA\">HSL</a> for all three (CSS, JavaScript, and Sass) and it worked. For example Saturation of 0.5 in JavaScript, means the same thing that Saturation of 0.5 in Sass. But they each have a different way of expressing that. In JavaScript I say &#39;*&#39;+(0.5+1), and in Sass I have to say ((0.5*100 )/2).toFixed(1)</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/energon.png\" alt=\"Energon Cubes: Crazy Design\"></p>\n<p>Energon Cubes: Crazy Design</p>\n<p>And when all is said and done Compiled <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com\">Sass</a> and <a href=\"/designer\">Designer</a> preview, match pixel for pixel, because of my use of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAw2_NtGNaA\">HSL</a> Color Model. The code for both is written by different programmer for different languages.</p>\n<p>And there is no way a person will get far, without some visual tool like the <a href=\"/designer\">Designer</a>.</p>\n<p>Manipulating colors is such a freaking delicate operation, a 5% difference in Saturation and Brightness can either make a design, or make it look off and crappy.</p>\n<p>There is no creating something like the Energon Experiment with a visual preview. Something as silly and useless as Energon required four separate revisions, to adjust blur/spread and colors, and the base color. It is just not possible without a tool.</p>\n<p>A lot of Programmers/Designers use the browser as it has some preview/editing features.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/bp.png\" alt=\"Browser Can&#39;t help with Sass SCSS for Bootstrap\"></p>\n<p>Browser Can&#39;t help with Sass SCSS for Bootstrap</p>\n<p>But how the heckedy heck to declare/extract variables, and generate Sass&#39;s SCSS code, that&#39;s not possible in the browser - lyke at all.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/calc.png\" alt=\"Still doing math in Sass\"></p>\n<p>Still doing math in Sass</p>\n<p>The code in Sass is still going to do some math based on the settings.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/setings.png\" alt=\"User&#39;s Settings\"></p>\n<p>User&#39;s Settings</p>\n<p>And the settings exists so that the user/customer can tweak things, they aren&#39;t really interested in building a new design, just making a slight alteration that makes sense in their business context.</p>\n<p>One such example is removing the top-right highlight, or darkening the bottom-most blur/drop shadow to match their webpage-background.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/box4.png\" alt=\"View of the different things at play.\"></p>\n<p>View of the different things at play.</p>\n<p>Now I need to make some serious presets that will get me closer to a more serious design:</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/real.jpg\" alt=\"Serious Design\"></p>\n<p>Serious Design</p>\n"

I created a program that creates a little overview of thier code for me, my program is able to understand all of their code now.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/overview.png\" alt=\"Bootstrap Code Overview\"></p>\n<p>Bootstrap Code Overview</p>\n<p>Overall, they come in with just about 5700 statements, talking about color, and text padding, and and little quirks and tricks. Looking over their work, I realized, If I touch any of this code they will hate me, with a passion.</p>\n<p>If I am to get accepted into <a href=\"https://themes.getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap Themes</a></p>\n<p>I can&#39;t automatically process their things, I have to make copies.</p>\n<p>For example: the Navbar on top of this web page is a lot of work, a lot of balancing and tweaking, and option adding.</p>\n<p>The only way I can touch it, is by making a copy, calling it SuperNavbar. And here, in the SuperNavbar, I can strip down colors, and apply my magical animations, and bits, and things.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#39;s progress. Progress with a bonus. Because at any point users can fall back on the original Navbar, and there is a couple ways to do that even. Anymore, work must arise from my Static Code Analysis here, from my little tools.</p>\n<p>At this point the Greatest Secret in Good Programming is kicking in: Rather than doing what I think I should do. I should do what is possible to do, with a hefty dose of code integrity, and program stability.</p>\n<p>More than that, my theme, my designs, should apply to many versions of Bootstrap, many of the <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/versions/\">past releases</a> - that&#39;s just good programming.</p>\n<p>Even if I stick to the v4.x branch (which is most reasonable), I will need to release 5 of 6 versions of my theme, and then maybe three more after that.</p>\n<p>I am very well aware, what a punch in the stomach all this is to the designers. The stuff that I am working on here, is really uncomfortable for most Designers. They don&#39;t want to process abstract syntax trees, or learn programming even.</p>\n<p>Also, a little twinkle of a business perspective is bubbling up here. Automated processing means bug free product, fast upgrades, fast support.</p>\n<p>But still, I am not sure what I will do to automate Design, once I do have SuperNavbar, presumably with all colors removed, and I make some classes like I have in <a href=\"/theme\">Theme</a> right now, to apply color to things, an interactive color, that supports mult-color-websites and multiple dark themes.</p>\n<p>Vary some fonts, and padding, and margins. I am still stuck with, what is basically... a <a href=\"https://bootswatch.com/\">basic theme</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/basic.png\" alt=\"Basic Theme\"></p>\n<p>Basic Theme</p>\n<p>I still have to come up with a Robotic Artist, that actually does <a href=\"http://pixelkit.com/kits/gui/\">real design</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/real.jpg\" alt=\"Real Design\"></p>\n<p>Real Design</p>\n<p>But... I think I know how to do that. You know how Megaman can <a href=\"https://youtu.be/3ufVQIUEiYc?t=40\">inherit weapons from their enemies by touch</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/megaman.jpg\" alt=\"Inherit Design\"></p>\n<p>Design Inheritance</p>\n<p>I think I can make some basic designs like beautifully styled boxes, and then AIM THEM AT SuperNavbar and SuperCard, and fire.</p>\n<p>SuperNavbar would then inherit properties of those Artistic Designs, background skin, inner shadow, blend gradients. Art is actually easy. I don&#39;t think anyone should ever sit down to decorating Navbars, the decorations must be carbon copied from something simpler, and certainly more reusable. THis way multiple components can be decorated at once.</p>\n<p>Wow, it is 2PM already. I am thinking about a lot of my programming projects at once, this coloring adventure is just relaxations.</p>\n"

I am using a system here that takes a snapshot of the code, and uploads that snapshot to catpea.com, that snapshot is shown to you before the real code loads. This helps the search engines process data, it improves load times by a huge amount. When I generate a website at noon, it will be bright, when I generate it at night it will be dark, this introduces complexity to something as silly as night mode. I just have the night mode run in manual now. By default the website is bright, and if the user clicks the light bulb it will switch to dark.</p>\n<p>It is a fun problem, it actually asks for User Preferences, where the user can put website coloring in manual.</p>\n<p>There is a technological problem lingering here, unfortunately. I can only animate transitions to dark. The system us unable to smoothly transition back to bright. This is a problem with <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a>&#39;s color information. Colors are so different from layout, that they should live in their own file, with their own programming. In Bootstrap 4.5.x this is not the case, and the code is ugly. In 5.0 they maybe fixing this (I am guessing), but it will forever be their solution, and they are unlikely to focus on nice to haves like smooth animations between color modes</p>\n<p>I need to take over <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a>&#39;s Colors. This is not easy. But I&#39;ve done it before. I nuked all the color declarations and automatically built a separate color file. It was a sophisticated, but primitive experiment. But automatic color declaration removal is critical, as Bootstrap changes their code all the time. With each new version I have to revise my code, that&#39;s not cool. With automatic processing, that will be much easier.</p>\n<p>See, coloring is not just about making a pretty scheme, it is a hard problem, and it requires hard programming, like parsing the SCSS code-base, deleting declarations in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), then dumping it back into a mere bootstrap.scss file. Then programming a general purpose coloring system capable of accounting for all the missing colors. I am going to leave this for later, automated processing is never without problems. Goodness knows, Bootstrap is trying to keep the colors kind of outside of the main coed base, but the functions that apply colors are still un-uniform and deeply burred.</p>\n<p>To be realistic about what can be achieved in the <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> 4.0.x - 5.0 realm, I think I can only change the HUE, I can go from their blue to Orange, but I can&#39;t make the orange too dark, or too bright. This still solves the coloring problem, it is an extremely simple and effective solution</p>\n<p>There is yet another way of looking at color, and that is seeing it in relation to how readability is impacted. It would be possible to go from White-on-Blue to White-on-Yellow, so as long as I carefully calculated <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html\">wcag-contrast</a>, and altered the yellow to be within the same (or similar) range as blue.</p>\n<p>Playing with color now.</p>\n"

Basically what it came down to was asking, &quot;What am I going to do with a red/danger alert box, during night mode?&quot; And the answer is, it had to dark, everything has to be dark in night mode. There cannot be colorful things and especially things with backgrounds.</p>\n<p>HUGE BONUS! Applications that are written dark, that look good in dark colors, do not, at all, require dark more. It is simple and logical, but get this: Applications that are Bright, Silver, as most applications are... MUST BE REWRITTEN TO SUPPORT NIGHT MODE. Isn&#39;t that unusual. All my work does not need any changes because it is already in dark more.</p>\n<p>So, on this website, I don&#39;t really need night mode. But, as experimental research goes I do need a system for it. So here is how this will work. This very page, The Research Blog, will be the first one to get night mode, and will be put in dark more by default. Now if somebody wants DAY MODE, then they can switch it off, and the page will become blinding.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ll work on that for a couple of hours, it shouldn&#39;t take long, I already have a demo on the <a href=\"/theme\">Theme</a> page.</p>\n"

Basically, it comes down to not using any text colors unless it is necessary, at which point make sure the background matches. As to background colors, the primary color doe backgrounds is bg-dark, or if it is a white website then bg-light. The coloring has to be used as little as possible because it does not really work.</p>\n<p>Since I am using a programmable component layer over <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a>, I can automate colorification, combined with the notion that it must be used sparingly.

But this is easy, and every color has a separate slider, for a Human-based adjustment.

Success, Info, Warning, Danger are for non-creative decorations. And there is also two more colors Dark and Light. And I use these for backgrounds only. A dark website will use bg-dark for all the widgets, and a white website will use bg-light. There isn&#39;t really a way to flip-flop between the two without human intervention. In a couple of months I could outline a plan that would allow switching between dark and white. Personally, I think all websites and applications should be dark. I&#39;ll make a website that can switch between the two, but that will take some experimenting. <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> is the same way, they basically say if you want something dark say bg-dark+text-light and that hard-coded into the design.

But also, once the user establishes those 16 notes, they only need to worry about lighting those buttons up, it is always the same 16 notes per row... they just select where those notes are active. And beneath this grid is a list of instruments, and places where those 16 notes go. If the user places sharp-drums as the first instruments, selects all 16 note-spots, then it will play tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk BUT ONLY IF THE cell in the thing pictured above is lit.

I switched from <a href=\"https://github.com/sass/node-sass\">node-sass</a> to <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com\">Sass</a>, node-sass got old, I guess.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#39;t really paying too much attention to SASS (a UI programming language) because I think CSS should be shaped with JS, as these are native browser</p>\n<p>technologies. But since <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> is forcing me into <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com\">Sass</a>, I might as well make use of the language, and... I guess its functions as well.</p>\n<p>Since this is a new addition to the system, there is both a learning curve, and bugs.</p>\n<p>So I&#39;ve been trying to execute color.adjust(#6b717f, $red: 15); these are the big fancy new functions, but I&#39;ve been getting errors for days.</p>\n<p>Well, now that I switched to <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com\">Sass</a> (from node-sass) there were changes, but I still got an error.</p>\n<p>It turns out they have a new module system, and before I make use of the color function I have to execute @use &#39;sass:color&#39;; on top of the program file.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s how it is done in all programming languages, but since I upgraded, I had to learn few new things about the new version of the language.</p>\n<p>Now, this does not mean that I approve of the existence of the <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if\">SASS Programming Language</a> in my code. But it is OK.</p>\n<p>As the first, thing here, I created a custom function, this is written in JavaScript, and it is integrated with SASS. The function measures readability between a background color and a foreground color, and it is interesting... Because even though everyone says &quot;if readability is more than 4.5 you are peachy&quot;,</p>\n<p>When working with themes, when kind of knowing colors, the 4.5 threshold can be lowered down to 1.5 even.</p>\n<p>The big deal here is being able to say, keep darkening/lightening that color until it passes the readability test.</p>\n<p>Here is an image of a recent test of using my <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html\">wcag-contrast</a>(foreground, background) function until a color is readable.</p>\n<p>Note how text in the first column it not readable as the background and text-color converge in the middle.</p>\n<p>And now look at the second column, where SMART coloring is taking place.</p>\n<p>I know it is still dark, I kept the color change threshold very low on purpose, to make the overall UI graphics nice. The point is that the text is keeping up with the background, it is keeping juuuuuuust a wee bit above, un-readability.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2\" src=\"research/smart-color.png\" alt=\"GUI Ideas\"></p>\n<p>Automatic Coloring</p>\n<p>As a side-note, programming-wise this is not really impressive, it is like 5 lines of code, so pro-programmers would yawn at this, but it is a big deal for me, because I am getting really precise and delicate control over colors in my Dark Theme here, that it is only 5 lines of code, is great for me, I can just type in a bit of code and be done with worrying about color readability for some UI component or button/label combo. I like this. And I like being given the opportunity to ponder if I want something to grow brighter (like a label on a button) or darker, like in the case of a number-label on a table of data (like a row number in Excel).</p>\n"

You might have noticed that the Beat Sequencer started sounding too complicated for a bit, &quot;BPM&quot;, &quot;Parts&quot;, &quot;Beats&quot;, &quot;Octave&quot;, &quot;Note&quot;, &quot;Scientific Notation&quot;, this is one lesson I want to take away from the Sequencer, the song generator will have to be massively abstract, it will have a setting for Softness rather than Samples and Presets, it will say Advanced Workout, Intermediate Workout, instead of BPM and Beats.

But I am thinking about creating components for a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Digital+Audio+Workstation&amp;tbm=isch\">Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)</a> like <a href=\"https://www.ableton.com/en/live/\">Ableton</a>, right now the drawer is not impressive, but it will evolve beyond what Bootstrap can do. Already I am thinking that I should not use colors, but rather transparent shadows, so whatever color is in the background the drawer will inherit it automatically. <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> creates flat/raised things, and my additions may end up being graphically sunken. Plus, <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> creates structure, and I use it for layout and containers. They don&#39;t really create content that is specific for some purpose (like my DAW), they limit themselves to general purpose things. They do sell themes, and if I ever completed this project, they may accept mine into their store. I have much more to learn, and I still have to get used to their way of doing things.</p>\n"

A tiny collection will do, because we have the the synthesizer taking care of everything else. I added some Hip sounds to the THE WARRIOR Album Single and it does sound very well. Realistically it is difficult to call it music at this point, I have all the components but there were bugs along the way. <a href=\"https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Server-side_rendering\">Svelte Sapper</a> is complicated to visualize, it pre-creates some things, meaning before I publish to the website, Sapper will create a pre-ran version of the site.

It is the correct technology, and it didn&#39;t get me, but it does take a moment to figure out when a bug jumps out of nowhere.</p>\n"
