Generations</h1></div> <div class=ml-3><p><p>The present belongs to the current generation,<br> therefore the current generations can be said to be the most important.<p>Much is to be said on the subject of the great mistakes of the most recent century,<br> and just as importantly much is to be said about the mistakes we are repeating.<p>History books are waiting to be read,<br> they will help us understand current events across all nations.<p>To correct things, however,<br> is much more difficult.<p>This is because we were born into the world long after things were put in motion,<br> and the people in charge have not been granted the needed wisdom to understand their role.<p>To put it simply,<br> it is too late to teach the blind or corrupt.<p>Individuals who take part in harming the world, or preventing it from growing,<br> are too far invested, too long gone to be helped.<p>And it is a matter of help.<p>Those who advertise products, that they know cause cancer or other illnesses, are sick, their minds are broken.<br> they all once had an opportunity to become heroes, but they didn't know it.<p>I think we can assume, that in most situations,<br> a human being will choose Goodness over Evil,<br> unless they lack the Wisdom to tell the difference between the two.<p><br><br><p>The solution to all out problems is to first understand that we were born too late into all this,<br> the momentum of Climate Change and Business as Usual, Mass Incarceration and Poverty was too high to be stopped by a singe generation.<p>But it is hardly a challenge for a Wiser World,<br> a world that helps children to wisdom so that they can become Great Beings come their middle age.<p><br><br><p>We can't say the word "poverty" and sound like it is a cruel world,<br> we have to make it clear that it is a broken world looking for New Heroes, New Intellectuals, and New Leaders.<p>We can't say the word "prison" and make it sound like that's where bad people go,<br> we have to show our pain, and speak about how no Human belongs in a cage, how they needed a fair start,<br> and how prisons can only make a bad person worse.<p>We can't talk about climate change as something that has no real solution in sight,<br> but rather we have to say that adults today are not educated well enough, their minds are not great enough to comprehend the scale of the problem.<p><br><br><p>The world in its complexity, made it so that all of these heartbreaking problems,<br> double as a challenge, an opportunity to not just grow in wisdom to fix these problems, but to grow in Greatness as well.<p>The mistakes of today,<br> when presented as such become an opportunity to help a generation grow far beyond what we perceived as our own limits.<p>Whenever there is a problem that is too great for a generation,<br> know for certain that multiple consecutive generations will fix it, in their hard earned wisdom.<p>My Friends,<br> this is yet another reason to take to Books and Audio Books,<br> to study best we can, so that we may teach.<p>We maybe just a chain link in a world with many problems,<br> but even a single chain-link keeps it all connected.<p>Slow down, I know you are working hard,<br> slow down to a speed that lets you read books,<br> read, learn, and rise to the challenge of inspiring generations to their greatness, and their destiny as teachers.<p><br><br><p>The momentum of the mistakes of today,<br> will lose force in proportion to our ability to inspire the younger generation to greatness;<br> our ability to show them just how important they are, to the past, the present, the future, how it is all inseparable together.<p></div> <hr class="border-info my-5"></div></div> <div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-xxl-6
