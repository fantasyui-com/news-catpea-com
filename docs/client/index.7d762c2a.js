And here, in the SuperNavbar, I can strip down colors, and apply my magical animations, and bits, and things.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#39;s progress. Progress with a bonus. Because at any point users can fall back on the original Navbar, and there is a couple ways to do that even. Anymore, work must arise from my Static Code Analysis here, from my little tools.</p>\n<p>At this point the Greatest Secret in Good Programming is kicking in: Rather than doing what I think I should do. I should do what is possible to do, with a hefty dose of code integrity, and program stability.</p>\n<p>More than that, my theme, my designs, should apply to many versions of Bootstrap, many of the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/versions/">past releases</a> - that&#39;s just good programming.</p>\n<p>Even if I stick to the v4.x branch (which is most reasonable), I will need to release 5 of 6 versions of my theme, and then maybe three more after that.</p>\n<p>I am very well aware, what a punch in the stomach all this is to the designers. The stuff that I am working on here, is really uncomfortable for most Designers. They don&#39;t want to process abstract syntax trees, or learn programming even.</p>\n<p>Also, a little twinkle of a business perspective is bubbling up here. Automated processing means bug free product, fast upgrades, fast support.</p>\n<p>But still, I am not sure what I will do to automate Design, once I do have SuperNavbar, presumably with all colors removed, and I make some classes like I have in <a href="/theme">Theme</a> right now, to apply color to things, an interactive color, that supports mult-color-websites and multiple dark themes.</p>\n<p>Vary some fonts, and padding, and margins.

Art is actually easy. I don&#39;t think anyone should ever sit down to decorating Navbars, the decorations must be carbon copied from something simpler, and certainly more reusable. THis way multiple components can be decorated at once.</p>\n<p>Wow, it is 2PM already.

I am using a system here that takes a snapshot of the code, and uploads that snapshot to catpea.com, that snapshot is shown to you before the real code loads. This helps the search engines process data, it improves load times by a huge amount. When I generate a website at noon, it will be bright, when I generate it at night it will be dark, this introduces complexity to something as silly as night mode. I just have the night mode run in manual now. By default the website is bright, and if the user clicks the light bulb it will switch to dark.</p>\n<p>It is a fun problem, it actually asks for User Preferences, where the user can put website coloring in manual.</p>\n<p>There is a technological problem lingering here, unfortunately. I can only animate transitions to dark. The system us unable to smoothly transition back to bright. This is a problem with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>&#39;s color information. Colors are so different from layout, that they should live in their own file, with their own programming. In Bootstrap 4.5.x this is not the case, and the code is ugly. In 5.0 they maybe fixing this (I am guessing), but it will forever be their solution, and they are unlikely to focus on nice to haves like smooth animations between color modes</p>\n<p>I need to take over <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>&#39;s Colors. This is not easy. But I&#39;ve done it before. I nuked all the color declarations and automatically built a separate color file. It was a sophisticated, but primitive experiment. But automatic color declaration removal is critical, as Bootstrap changes their code all the time. With each new version I have to revise my code, that&#39;s not cool. With automatic processing, that will be much easier.</p>\n<p>See, coloring is not just about making a pretty scheme, it is a hard problem, and it requires hard programming, like parsing the SCSS code-base, deleting declarations in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), then dumping it back into a mere bootstrap.scss file. Then programming a general purpose coloring system capable of accounting for all the missing colors. I am going to leave this for later, automated processing is never without problems. Goodness knows, Bootstrap is trying to keep the colors kind of outside of the main coed base, but the functions that apply colors are still un-uniform and deeply burred.</p>\n<p>To be realistic about what can be achieved in the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> 4.0.x - 5.0 realm, I think I can only change the HUE, I can go from their blue to Orange, but I can&#39;t make the orange too dark, or too bright. This still solves the coloring problem, it is an extremely simple and effective solution</p>\n<p>There is yet another way of looking at color, and that is seeing it in relation to how readability is impacted. It would be possible to go from White-on-Blue to White-on-Yellow, so as long as I carefully calculated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html">wcag-contrast</a>, and altered the yellow to be within the same (or similar) range as blue.</p>\n<p>Playing with color now.</p>\n'},{id:"id97",title:"Citizens of The World",category:"quarantine",tags:"Poem",date:"2020-04-11T03:42:57.257Z",draft:!1,deleted:!1,html:'<p>Captain&#39;s Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Five,</p>\n<p>Yesterday, Bernie dropped out.</p>\n<p>I didn&#39;t even try to wait, you can&#39;t place this much weight.</p>\n<p>And what were we expecting?</p>\n<p>It has always been like this, hit and miss.</p>\n<p>It is time for all, to rise.</p>\n<p>Become a Citizen of The World.

There cannot be colorful things and especially things with backgrounds.</p>\n<p>HUGE BONUS! Applications that are written dark, that look good in dark colors, do not, at all, require dark more.

All my work does not need any changes because it is already in dark more.</p>\n<p>So, on this website, I don&#39;t really need night mode. But, as experimental research goes I do need a system for it. So here is how this will work. This very page, The Research Blog, will be the first one to get night mode, and will be put in dark more by default.

Basically, it comes down to not using any text colors unless it is necessary, at which point make sure the background matches. As to background colors, the primary color doe backgrounds is bg-dark, or if it is a white website then bg-light.

A dark website will use bg-dark for all the widgets, and a white website will use bg-light. There isn&#39;t really a way to flip-flop between the two without human intervention. In a couple of months I could outline a plan that would allow switching between dark and white. Personally, I think all websites and applications should be dark. I&#39;ll make a website that can switch between the two, but that will take some experimenting. <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> is the same way, they basically say if you want something dark say bg-dark+text-light and that hard-coded into the design.
