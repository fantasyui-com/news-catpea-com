And this &quot;way&quot; is the problem, that I&#39;ve been attempting to research.</p>\n<p>So I finally came up with an idea worth trying out and that is creating a meta-front-end, a sugar layer on top. Here is a very rough sketch of a syntax conducive to creating reactive applications.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-xml">\n&lt;application&gt;\n\n\n  &lt;database id=bodybuilding url=&quot;bodybuilding.json&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;interval seconds=&quot;{interval}&quot; min=&quot;0&quot; max=&quot;{bodybuilding.length}&quot; step=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\n\n  &lt;card&gt;\n\n    &lt;header array=&quot;Advice, Preferences&quot;/&gt;\n\n    &lt;body if=&quot;advice&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;text string=&quot;message&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n\n    &lt;body if=&quot;preferences&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;range id=&quot;interval&quot; min=0 max=&quot;120&quot; step=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n\n    &lt;tail&gt;\n      Showing body building advice #1, out of 50.\n    &lt;/tail&gt;\n\n  &lt;/card&gt;\n\n&lt;/application&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This &quot;code&quot; represents about 90% o that little bodybuilding advice application on catpea.com.</p>\n<p>And I think that is as far as I would like to go. From here the programmer would click a button and generate code for Svelte, possibly React. This would solve all Component problems, stuff like re-usability, and nesting, and template slots.</p>\n<p>What I like about this is that it is basically a code generator, and not a language. It is trivial to make, and the end result would be a huge folder full of files, and properly setup configuration stuff.</p>\n<p>It seems to be a fair bet that this Meta-programming layer would target Angular, React, Svelte, Vue and few others.</p>\n<p>And that would be very useful for presenting Small Application Starters in multiple languages. Here I am thinking about Bootstrap Themes, again.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, this solves my only problem with Reactive Programming, lack of a fast programmable front-end language.

Bootstrap&#39;s Tab bar uses a background trick, that demands I set a background for a tab, so it can hide the selected tab bottom-border. They should not be using a trick, if tabs are not possible without CSS/HTML trick, then they should not be shipped.</p>\n<p>In Svelte they would not allow me to do Svelte things on Components I created.</p>\n<p>For example, I cannot say this button should be sent to a template slot named menu, it trows: &quot;&#39;slot&#39; is reserved for future use in named slots&quot;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I could not apply a conditional class on a Custom component as it would throw: &quot;Classes can only be applied to DOM elements, not components&quot;</p>\n<p>So, I cannot create general purpose custom Bootstrap components.</p>\n<p>I had a weird feeling about it from the beginning.</p>\n<p>So now, I cannot create Custom Stores, I cannot create Custom Components.</p>\n<p>Fair enough.

But it will require Visual Programming Tools. With another abstraction layer over a programming language, the gravity of code duplication, meta-programming, documentation, maintenance shifts and may a allow a perfect programming language, but that is far and different universe, it has nothing to do with Svelte.</p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that I looked at <a href="https://www.sweetjs.org/">Sweet.js</a> this morning, as I sometimes do. It is meta-programming or super-programming for JavaScript, and I was able to define one property of a proper language: LOW CODE DENSITY. This means that the language is suited for the task at hand and need not be twisted. Custom Stores in Svelte cause twisting:</p>\n<p><img class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2" src="research/t-1.png" alt="research/t-1.png"></p>\n<p>In React, a three line example is enough to show twisting:</p>\n<p><img class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2" src="research/t-2.png" alt="research/t-3.png"></p>\n<p>With meta-programming, with super-programming that code can reduced to a single clean statement. And meta-programming will work for all languages. Svelte uses meta-programming, the layer for custom stores is just not complete, or or is meant to be more flexible.</p>\n<p>Maybe, Low Code Density, or Untwisted Code can only be achieved on per project basis, and only with meta-programming.</p>\n<p>After all Svelte&#39;s Might is the Meta Programming setup.</p>\n<p>I a glad I mention <a href="https://www.sweetjs.org/">Sweet.js</a> here.</p>\n<p>Then there is the question of HTML vs Flex/Swing, or question of Containers and Components like old <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> is/was <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.10/dijit_layout/">doing</a>.\nA high level nestable container framework would cut down on UI code considerably. Combination of Meta Programming (to obscure reactive boilerplate) and Components/Containers could potentially create a Rapid Application Development platform with code worth reading.

Moreover, Svelte already compiles to WebComponents, and WebComponents will forever lack (by default) a good automatic data to UI updates, because they are not designed to make programming reasonable, unlike Svelte.</p>\n<p>These important Theme-Extras therefore, must be written in Svelte. And Cat Pea, is a prime example of what an Extra would look like. All those little boxes, little menus, little drawers, bits of Music Making, Bodybuilding Advice, all of that are snippets of code that will make this theme sell. The news site, is not a good snippet, it should be included, but it is too monolithic, it is just buttons for browsing posts.</p>\n<p>I will need to redesign Cat Pea with that in mind, so my programming adventure is also making a tiny product for <a href="https://themes.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap Themes</a>. Anyhow, here are the newly added UI improvements.</p>\n<p>Here is the new Home Page, it looks like an App, because the user is browsing All Posts at first.\nI think it would be better to create a Home Page that first opens to 5 latest posts, and I may do that later.</p>\n<p><img class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2" src="research/news-update-1.png" alt="Updates"></p>\n<p>This is Category View, it is a lot cleaner, but it is very busy.

I&#39;ll have toggle tat off into a mini miniature, I&#39;d like to see just the post here, I&#39;ll add a &quot;Quick Nav&quot; box and when that&#39;s opened the quick navigation features will show up. Reading a post should just be about a post.</p>\n<p>I like the Listen button, and I like the fact that it fits well on the home page.</p>\n<p><img class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2" src="research/news-update-3.png" alt="Updates"></p>\n<p>The one big change is that there is no more Player, the user has to click the button to see it. This is because every browser has it&#39;s own player.

I am exporting information to multiple programming languages, JavaScript, CSS, and Sass. And in the case of Sass, I need to pass CONFIGURATION VARIABLES so that the customers can tweak them.

For example Saturation of 0.5 in JavaScript, means the same thing that Saturation of 0.5 in Sass. But they each have a different way of expressing that.

And here, in the SuperNavbar, I can strip down colors, and apply my magical animations, and bits, and things.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#39;s progress. Progress with a bonus. Because at any point users can fall back on the original Navbar, and there is a couple ways to do that even. Anymore, work must arise from my Static Code Analysis here, from my little tools.</p>\n<p>At this point the Greatest Secret in Good Programming is kicking in: Rather than doing what I think I should do. I should do what is possible to do, with a hefty dose of code integrity, and program stability.</p>\n<p>More than that, my theme, my designs, should apply to many versions of Bootstrap, many of the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/versions/">past releases</a> - that&#39;s just good programming.</p>\n<p>Even if I stick to the v4.x branch (which is most reasonable), I will need to release 5 of 6 versions of my theme, and then maybe three more after that.</p>\n<p>I am very well aware, what a punch in the stomach all this is to the designers. The stuff that I am working on here, is really uncomfortable for most Designers. They don&#39;t want to process abstract syntax trees, or learn programming even.</p>\n<p>Also, a little twinkle of a business perspective is bubbling up here. Automated processing means bug free product, fast upgrades, fast support.</p>\n<p>But still, I am not sure what I will do to automate Design, once I do have SuperNavbar, presumably with all colors removed, and I make some classes like I have in <a href="/theme">Theme</a> right now, to apply color to things, an interactive color, that supports mult-color-websites and multiple dark themes.</p>\n<p>Vary some fonts, and padding, and margins.

I am using a system here that takes a snapshot of the code, and uploads that snapshot to catpea.com, that snapshot is shown to you before the real code loads. This helps the search engines process data, it improves load times by a huge amount. When I generate a website at noon, it will be bright, when I generate it at night it will be dark, this introduces complexity to something as silly as night mode. I just have the night mode run in manual now. By default the website is bright, and if the user clicks the light bulb it will switch to dark.</p>\n<p>It is a fun problem, it actually asks for User Preferences, where the user can put website coloring in manual.</p>\n<p>There is a technological problem lingering here, unfortunately. I can only animate transitions to dark. The system us unable to smoothly transition back to bright. This is a problem with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>&#39;s color information. Colors are so different from layout, that they should live in their own file, with their own programming. In Bootstrap 4.5.x this is not the case, and the code is ugly. In 5.0 they maybe fixing this (I am guessing), but it will forever be their solution, and they are unlikely to focus on nice to haves like smooth animations between color modes</p>\n<p>I need to take over <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>&#39;s Colors. This is not easy. But I&#39;ve done it before. I nuked all the color declarations and automatically built a separate color file. It was a sophisticated, but primitive experiment. But automatic color declaration removal is critical, as Bootstrap changes their code all the time. With each new version I have to revise my code, that&#39;s not cool. With automatic processing, that will be much easier.</p>\n<p>See, coloring is not just about making a pretty scheme, it is a hard problem, and it requires hard programming, like parsing the SCSS code-base, deleting declarations in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), then dumping it back into a mere bootstrap.scss file. Then programming a general purpose coloring system capable of accounting for all the missing colors. I am going to leave this for later, automated processing is never without problems. Goodness knows, Bootstrap is trying to keep the colors kind of outside of the main coed base, but the functions that apply colors are still un-uniform and deeply burred.</p>\n<p>To be realistic about what can be achieved in the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> 4.0.x - 5.0 realm, I think I can only change the HUE, I can go from their blue to Orange, but I can&#39;t make the orange too dark, or too bright. This still solves the coloring problem, it is an extremely simple and effective solution</p>\n<p>There is yet another way of looking at color, and that is seeing it in relation to how readability is impacted.
