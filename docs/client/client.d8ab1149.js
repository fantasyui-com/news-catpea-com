Moreover, Svelte already compiles to WebComponents, and WebComponents will forever lack (by default) a good automatic data to UI updates, because they are not designed to make programming reasonable, unlike Svelte.</p>\n<p>These important Theme-Extras therefore, must be written in Svelte. And Cat Pea, is a prime example of what an Extra would look like. All those little boxes, little menus, little drawers, bits of Music Making, Bodybuilding Advice, all of that are snippets of code that will make this theme sell. The news site, is not a good snippet, it should be included, but it is too monolithic, it is just buttons for browsing posts.</p>\n<p>I will need to redesign Cat Pea with that in mind, so my programming adventure is also making a tiny product for <a href="https://themes.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap Themes</a>. Anyhow, here are the newly added UI improvements.</p>\n<p>Here is the new Home Page, it looks like an App, because the user is browsing All Posts at first.\nI think it would be better to create a Home Page that first opens to 5 latest posts, and I may do that later.</p>\n<p><img class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2" src="research/news-update-1.png" alt="Updates"></p>\n<p>This is Category View, it is a lot cleaner, but it is very busy.

I&#39;ll have toggle tat off into a mini miniature, I&#39;d like to see just the post here, I&#39;ll add a &quot;Quick Nav&quot; box and when that&#39;s opened the quick navigation features will show up. Reading a post should just be about a post.</p>\n<p>I like the Listen button, and I like the fact that it fits well on the home page.</p>\n<p><img class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2" src="research/news-update-3.png" alt="Updates"></p>\n<p>The one big change is that there is no more Player, the user has to click the button to see it. This is because every browser has it&#39;s own player. The stablest method is to add the button that just links to the mp3 file.</p>\n<p>I also setup an external repository for my writing over on <a href="https://github.com/fantasyui-com/news">Github</a> it is not easy to navigate, but if I ever lose catpea.com domain name, or github is down, or technology changes, there is always this external master that has all the text and poems and my <a href="https://github.com/fantasyui-com/news/tree/master/poems">recordings</a> mostly accessible.

And here, in the SuperNavbar, I can strip down colors, and apply my magical animations, and bits, and things.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#39;s progress. Progress with a bonus. Because at any point users can fall back on the original Navbar, and there is a couple ways to do that even. Anymore, work must arise from my Static Code Analysis here, from my little tools.</p>\n<p>At this point the Greatest Secret in Good Programming is kicking in: Rather than doing what I think I should do. I should do what is possible to do, with a hefty dose of code integrity, and program stability.</p>\n<p>More than that, my theme, my designs, should apply to many versions of Bootstrap, many of the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/versions/">past releases</a> - that&#39;s just good programming.</p>\n<p>Even if I stick to the v4.x branch (which is most reasonable), I will need to release 5 of 6 versions of my theme, and then maybe three more after that.</p>\n<p>I am very well aware, what a punch in the stomach all this is to the designers. The stuff that I am working on here, is really uncomfortable for most Designers. They don&#39;t want to process abstract syntax trees, or learn programming even.</p>\n<p>Also, a little twinkle of a business perspective is bubbling up here. Automated processing means bug free product, fast upgrades, fast support.</p>\n<p>But still, I am not sure what I will do to automate Design, once I do have SuperNavbar, presumably with all colors removed, and I make some classes like I have in <a href="/theme">Theme</a> right now, to apply color to things, an interactive color, that supports mult-color-websites and multiple dark themes.</p>\n<p>Vary some fonts, and padding, and margins.

Art is actually easy. I don&#39;t think anyone should ever sit down to decorating Navbars, the decorations must be carbon copied from something simpler, and certainly more reusable.

I am using a system here that takes a snapshot of the code, and uploads that snapshot to catpea.com, that snapshot is shown to you before the real code loads. This helps the search engines process data, it improves load times by a huge amount. When I generate a website at noon, it will be bright, when I generate it at night it will be dark, this introduces complexity to something as silly as night mode. I just have the night mode run in manual now. By default the website is bright, and if the user clicks the light bulb it will switch to dark.</p>\n<p>It is a fun problem, it actually asks for User Preferences, where the user can put website coloring in manual.</p>\n<p>There is a technological problem lingering here, unfortunately. I can only animate transitions to dark. The system us unable to smoothly transition back to bright. This is a problem with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>&#39;s color information. Colors are so different from layout, that they should live in their own file, with their own programming. In Bootstrap 4.5.x this is not the case, and the code is ugly. In 5.0 they maybe fixing this (I am guessing), but it will forever be their solution, and they are unlikely to focus on nice to haves like smooth animations between color modes</p>\n<p>I need to take over <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>&#39;s Colors. This is not easy. But I&#39;ve done it before. I nuked all the color declarations and automatically built a separate color file. It was a sophisticated, but primitive experiment. But automatic color declaration removal is critical, as Bootstrap changes their code all the time. With each new version I have to revise my code, that&#39;s not cool. With automatic processing, that will be much easier.</p>\n<p>See, coloring is not just about making a pretty scheme, it is a hard problem, and it requires hard programming, like parsing the SCSS code-base, deleting declarations in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), then dumping it back into a mere bootstrap.scss file. Then programming a general purpose coloring system capable of accounting for all the missing colors. I am going to leave this for later, automated processing is never without problems. Goodness knows, Bootstrap is trying to keep the colors kind of outside of the main coed base, but the functions that apply colors are still un-uniform and deeply burred.</p>\n<p>To be realistic about what can be achieved in the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> 4.0.x - 5.0 realm, I think I can only change the HUE, I can go from their blue to Orange, but I can&#39;t make the orange too dark, or too bright. This still solves the coloring problem, it is an extremely simple and effective solution</p>\n<p>There is yet another way of looking at color, and that is seeing it in relation to how readability is impacted.

I guess its functions as well.</p>\n<p>Since this is a new addition to the system, there is both a learning curve, and bugs.</p>\n<p>So I&#39;ve been trying to execute color.adjust(#6b717f, $red: 15); these are the big fancy new functions, but I&#39;ve been getting errors for days.</p>\n<p>Well, now that I switched to <a href="https://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> (from node-sass) there were changes, but I still got an error.</p>\n<p>It turns out they have a new module system, and before I make use of the color function I have to execute @use &#39;sass:color&#39;; on top of the program file.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s how it is done in all programming languages, but since I upgraded, I had to learn few new things about the new version of the language.</p>\n<p>Now, this does not mean that I approve of the existence of the <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if">SASS Programming Language</a> in my code. But it is OK.</p>\n<p>As the first, thing here, I created a custom function, this is written in JavaScript, and it is integrated with SASS. The function measures readability between a background color and a foreground color, and it is interesting... Because even though everyone says &quot;if readability is more than 4.5 you are peachy&quot;,</p>\n<p>When working with themes, when kind of knowing colors, the 4.5 threshold can be lowered down to 1.5 even.</p>\n<p>The big deal here is being able to say, keep darkening/lightening that color until it passes the readability test.</p>\n<p>Here is an image of a recent test of using my <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html">wcag-contrast</a>(foreground, background) function until a color is readable.</p>\n<p>Note how text in the first column it not readable as the background and text-color converge in the middle.</p>\n<p>And now look at the second column, where SMART coloring is taking place.</p>\n<p>I know it is still dark, I kept the color change threshold very low on purpose, to make the overall UI graphics nice. The point is that the text is keeping up with the background, it is keeping juuuuuuust a wee bit above, un-readability.</p>\n<p><img class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2" src="research/smart-color.png" alt="GUI Ideas"></p>\n<p>Automatic Coloring</p>\n<p>As a side-note, programming-wise this is not really impressive, it is like 5 lines of code, so pro-programmers would yawn at this, but it is a big deal for me, because I am getting really precise and delicate control over colors in my Dark Theme here, that it is only 5 lines of code, is great for me, I can just type in a bit of code and be done with worrying about color readability for some UI component or button/label combo. I like this. And I like being given the opportunity to ponder if I want something to grow brighter (like a label on a button) or darker, like in the case of a number-label on a table of data (like a row number in Excel).</p>\n'},{id:"id67",title:"Teacher",category:"quarantine",tags:"Poem",date:"2020-04-03T23:59:02.881Z",draft:!1,deleted:!1,html:'<p>Captain&#39;s Log: Day Eighteen of Quarantine.</p>\n<p>Researching, learning, computers being mean.</p>\n<p>It must be Friday, the eve of Eighteen,</p>\n<p>I peeked outside and I think the trees are turning green.</p>\n<p>But the squirrels, again, they act so weird,</p>\n<p>smart little kitties worried that everyone disappeared.</p>\n<p>Speaking of weird, programming is such a fun game,</p>\n<p>I am convinced it is unhealthy, but I think that&#39;s a shame.</p>\n<p>My computer programs kept me company since I was nine,</p>\n<p>I was so little, and already learning the command line.</p>\n<p>Alas, the time doth fly,</p>\n<p>as we grow older we must take to the sky.</p>\n<p>We have to learn beyond what is at our fingertips,</p>\n<p>and set aims for all those leaderships.</p>\n<p>We should pamper our talents, can&#39;t leave them behind,</p>\n<p>as we grow older they&#39;ll play a very important role in our peace of mind.</p>\n<p>My readers, we are each charged with becoming Teachers,</p>\n<p>share our knowledge, become Reason&#39;s own preachers.</p>\n<p>The Future is only as bright as Her Humanity,</p>\n<p>we are Her dignity, Her keepers of sanity.</p>\n<p>So, search for <a href="/warrior">video tutorials</a>,</p>\n<p>maybe open a book,</p>\n<p>and take a look.</p>\n'},{id:"id66",title:"Zoinks I Started Work On A Graphical Theme For Applications I Called It It Provides Extensions For And Components Based On...",category:"research",tags:"Programming",date:"2020-04-03T23:25:54.011Z",draft:!1,deleted:!1,html:'<p>Zoinks!

Plus, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> creates structure, and I use it for layout and containers. They don&#39;t really create content that is specific for some purpose (like my DAW), they limit themselves to general purpose things. They do sell themes, and if I ever completed this project, they may accept mine into their store.
