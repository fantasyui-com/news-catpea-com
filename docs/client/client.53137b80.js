you must be careful,\nas the world may not yet be ready to help you.</p><p>Not everyone will know about growing up,<br>\nand people will say: &quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;</p><p>And they are not going to be the bad guys,<br>\nand you will be inclined to listen to their advice.</p><p>And the path will be paved with good intentions,<br>\nit maybe the correct path, but it won&apos;t be the right one.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Please, focus on building your own self,<br>\nyour strength, your wisdom, your power.</p><p>Focus on building the best you,<br>\nthe you that you are meant to be, that the world needs.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Because if you listen to everybody else,<br>\nyou will not grow up, and they will blame you for not being able to help them.</p><p>You are not going to be able to explain to them,<br>\nthat you are weak because of them,<br>\nbecause you tried to help them too early.</p><p>And if you could, all they could say will be:<br>\n&quot;How was I supposed to know?&quot;</p><p><br><br></p><p>Please, you have no choice,<br>\nbut to learn to control your own future.</p><p>You can try to use your imagination,<br>\nto get in touch with your Elder Self;</p><p>And ask &quot;What are your regrets?&quot;,<br>\n&quot;Where did it go wrong?&quot;</p><p><br><br></p><p>Please, carefully evaluate your choices,<br>\nwisely build your Mind and

yet,<br>\npeople are struggling to understand life.</p><p>Many make choices that all too early box them in,<br>\nand not all their advice will apply to you.</p><p>Not all the things that you think box people in,<br>\nactually constrain them, there are many contexts to all the paths.</p><p>All lives are beautiful, and there are enough forks in the road,<br>\nfor people to navigate back to where they want to be.</p><p>But, when a mistake occurs, it will weigh you down for a time,<br>\nif you are careful, you can avoid the worst of it.</p><p>And whatever does happen, regardless of how hard you tried to avoid it,<br>\nwill not crush you, because you will know you did your best.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Please, be careful in life, be beautiful, and strong,<br>\nlearn, and think, and evaluate, and judge, and grow in wisdom.</p><p>Following everyone&apos;s advice, will create a lot of noise,<br>\nlistening to everything from everywhere will never align with you.</p><p>You must lean to pace

wisdom.</p><p>There is nothing you can be force-taught school,<br>\nyou will not retain things that are out of sequence.</p><p>Reaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom in your own sequence, and at your own pace,<br>\nis the only way to learn, and build steps, and build on top of those steps.</p><p>No one can decide what lesson you are ready for next,<br>\nthat is something that comes from the

sequence.</p><p><br><br></p><p>The same applies to your job, your career,<br>\nyour career needs to emerge from the path you were growing up with.</p><p>It needs to be an an extension of your pursuits,<br>\nit must benefit you, and help you grow.</p><p>Just like you must actually learn, instead of just getting grades,<br>\nyour work must add to you, and not, rob you of your years.</p><p>Do you understand the value of a Single Year of Your Precious Life?<br>\nno one can put a price on that, not even you, there are not enough atoms in the Universe.</p><p>That is why Harmony with

and get on with life.</p><p>I am so sorry, My Friends,<br>\nbut that is the worst, you can do.</p><p>That&apos;s why you can&apos;t listen to anyone,<br>\nthat&apos;s why you have to look into

a field where your job makes life more stressful,<br>\nwhich will prevent you from taking good care of your body?</p><p>Imagine the consequences of walking a path that is not truly your own,<br>\nand what will your Elder Self feel when you two finally become, One?</p><p>Be gentle with yourself,<br>\nthis is Your Life, Your Beautiful-Beautiful Life.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Put down the incomprehensible Text Book, the standardized tests,<br>\nand <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/130.Best_Audiobooks_Ever">find</a> an Audiobook that you will love and actually learn from.</p><p>Stop trying to find a job or get hired, and become the kind of a person;<br>\nthat companies can only hope to hire.</p><p>Start living healthy, years before you start your training,<br>\ndo not force your body into endurance, gradually teach it to adapt.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Chose Audio-books that really help your wisdom grow,<br>\nembrace your hobbies, and expand your

had in your constellation.</p><p>Organized Education, poisons your confidence in education, because everything they teach,<br>\nis in an inhuman, synthetic, and impersonal sequence.</p><p>Moreover, the easily forgotten and fragile clusters of incomplete information,<br>\naim to build on one another, they guarantee you won&apos;t understand, and will only overwhelm you in the end.</p><p>The celebrating of a Diploma, is a sacred ritual, that has been erased, and replaced,<br>\nwith a more sugarcoated &quot;I am finally out&quot;.</p><p>This is a perfect recipe for bondage, blindness, weakness,<br>\nand worse.</p><p>We must not allow a fake sugar pop triumph,<br>\nto replace the Real Triumph or Knowledge and Wisdom.</p><p>It can only get worse,<br>\na day will come when the Libraries will close.</p><p>School and Library, above all, were meant to be a symbol,<br>\nan extension to your own self education.</p><p>Your Education,<br>\nthe pathway to Peace, Safety, Security, Self Control, Harmony, Enlightenment.</p><p><br><br></p><p>What has occurred to cause the fog, is a drop of packets of information,<br>\nwe are too complex, the world is too complex, parenting is too complex, teaching is too complex.</p><p>It can get worse, if we continue celebrating false graduations, and fake education,<br>\nif we keep forgetting that our family, has Eight Billion members and each must grow up for real.</p><p>The solution is to remind ourselves, that growing up is not about feeling like an adult,<br>\nbut rather Transcending our Limits, and Pushing Through gaps, towards Wisdom.</p><p>We face problems that can only be solved by Intellectual or Cultural Unity.</p><p>The Problem of War, is solved by Education, Wisdom, and Unity.</p><p>The Problem of Education, is solved by Helping Everyone to a Fair Start.</p><p>The Problem of Crime, can be Solved by Mental Heath Care, and Prevention.</p><p>The Problem of Poverty and Slavery, is Solved by Universal Income.</p><p>All these problems are our problems, and the solutions are ours as well.</p><p>But they rest across a Gap, a gap that Humanity must cross.</p><p>And the next step,<br>\nis your step.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Nothing worth your precious time, can be faked, or made up, or make believe,<br>\nit all has to be Authentic, Powerful, Guttural, Raw.</p><p>It will hurt in the Muscle and Bone,<br>\nbut eventually you&apos;ll forget to pay attention to what is unimportant.</p><p>You are not to be taught that you are dime a dozen,<br>\nand that they just can&apos;t find a job for you, because you don&apos;t fit or conform.</p><p>People believe this nonsense,<br>\nbecause they don&apos;t have anything to draw from by subtle analogy.</p><p>That is why we must challenge ourselves to Great Deeds,<br>\nto acquire the experiences necessary to tell Wisdom from Waste.</p><p>When you hear someone putting you down, pushing you around, belittling you,<br>\nyou are to leave, because that someone has fractured and broke, and are now ill.</p><p>It is the oldest and sickest trick,<br>\nto convince someone they don&apos;t matter.</p><p>They do it for personal gain, money or laziness,<br>\nto people who do not have a library of Grand Experiences from which they can draw wisdom, by Subtle Analogy.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Get Up.</p><p>Find your temple of solitude, The Two Beautiful Trees, The Bridge Over Hudson River,<br>\nThe Highway Overpass, The Starry Beach where the Stars Come Out at Night and mingle with Starfish.</p><p>And know, that you are a Child of The Universe, first,<br>\nThat! is your background.</p><p>Now face Humanity anew,<br>\nout from the edge of the Universe.</p><p>Look,<br>\nlook at all those things that made you small.</p><p>Look how unimportant the inauthentic is,<br>\nhow fragile those words that upset you really were.</p><p><br><br></p><p>And pay attention, to the real problem,<br>\nhow easily you were tricked and mislead.</p><p>That cannot go on,<br>\nyou are not a push around.</p><p>I wish you knew how Powerful you really are,<br>\nhow easily you learn at your own pace in the sequence that fits you best.</p><p>How All Too Human, all too familiar, all too easy,<br>\nthe acquisition of wisdom really is.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Not all Adults are defined by Outspoken Wisdom, some find Greatness in Love Returned,<br>\nand what a Great Power, can those Two even make a mistake?</p><p>I don&apos;t think there is anything other than Love, that can substitute for Wisdom,<br>\nit is both The Love of Two, and The Love of a Big Mother in a large family,<br>\na Mother that always brings hugs, warm meals and Wisdom.</p><p>But, True Love is rare, so while you search, you must also grow in Wisdom,<br>\nfrom now on, you will have to learn to tell the children apart from the adults.</p><p>And not by looking at how old they are, or how well they dress, or how sharply they move in their environment,<br>\nyou will now look at their Authenticity, and Content of Character.</p><p>No one who lacks in Authenticity, or has little Content of Character,<br>\nhas anything to contribute to you life, certainly nothing negative.</p><p>Hope for them to recover, and become wise, and healthy,<br>\nlet them know that they are a Child of The Universe, and they count - but go.</p><p>Don&apos;t let anybody hurt you,<br>\ndon&apos;t let anybody hurt your heart, or mind.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Go!<br>\nbecause you need your heart and mind, to grow.</p><p>Go!,<br>\nwith the certainty of knowing that you are more.</p><p>Go!,<br>\nso as long as you Rise you won&apos;t be lonely for long.</p><p>Go!<br>\nbecause there has never been a way other than forward and up.</p><p>Go!<br>\nand don&apos;t be scared, all great journeys start with little things.</p><p><br><br></p><p>The Others, who went through the same,<br>\nare with you in Spirit.</p><p>So many invisible battles have been fought,<br>\nand as much triumph gone unnoticed.</p><p>The Warriors are everywhere, and they stand by your side,<br>\nyou are in company of Great Heroes.</p><p>Climb by subtle analogy to the triumphs already had,<br>\nrise to the highest of mountains.</p><p>You are Meant to Become a Great Being,<br>\nand You are meant to remind others to follow a similar path.</p><p>Rise, and you will be well on your way,<br>\nHumanity only grows, when people like you tear down those thin invisible walls.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Wherever you are right now, begin transcending your limits,<br>\nno matter how small, each will help you learn more.</p><p>With each new success more pathways will become visible to you,<br>\nyou are not trapped, you are just at the beginning of your journey.</p><p>It is hard to see it all because you are still learning,<br>\nbut it is easy to read or listen to books, and inherit great visions from others.</p><p>It will never get easier,<br>\nbut you will grow greater, to a point where ease will become irrelevant to your existence.</p><p>You must use your Heart and Mind to learn all the lessons ahead,<br>\nno one can teach you, you must find your own books.</p><p>By Subtle

Universe mixed it self for so long<br>\nthat the failure for life to occur became inconceivable.</p><p>And, we want to believe life emerged, on Earth,<br>\njust like we wanted to believe that earth was the center of the Universe.</p><p>And we want to believe that Earth was the first to have life,<br>\nmy goodness, how much more special could we be, the first in the Universe.</p><p>Universe is a large place, that has been around for a long time,<br>\nit is better not to think of anything cosmic, as that! special.</p><p>But there is one exception.</p><p>Once you come down to Earth, come up to Life, and look then Into The Conscious Self Aware Mind,<br>\nthat is no longer a common occurrence.</p><p>There is nothing normal about it,<br>\nwe are now at the limits of what the Universe could possibly conceive of.</p><p>No machine or hybrid can measure up to the raw power of unleashed consciousness.</p><p>Nothing partially conscious, can know the depth of Sadness,<br>\nnothing less than conscious could know the Miracle of Happiness.</p><p><br><br></p><p>We are used to thinking of ourselves as work horses,<br>\ngreat locomotives that can plow through Pandemics, or a Broken Heart.</p><p>But that is a temporary oversimplification just to keep visions clear,<br>\nborn of a finely tuned mind that can narrow all views down to the important bits.</p><p>Focus and selective attention is not a limitation of our mind,<br>\nit is a feature that clears away unimportant things.</p><p>When we need recall, we can have it in full,<br>\njust imagine your favorite place, and trace along the walls.</p><p>Every window, picture, appliance, and outlet, all the important knickknacks are all there,<br>\nwe don&apos;t have memory problems, we don&apos;t need better brains.</p><p>The convergence that we need is not about integrating with technology,<br>\nbut combining the good parts of our cultures, so that the world can learn towards Peace.</p><p>Without that shared wisdom, people are easily tricked to believe in conflict,<br>\ninto the belief that there are borders, and across borders they must fight.</p><p>By not helping each other to understand how special and unique we each are,<br>\nthere grows a vocal minority of machine like minds, that think in mechanical terms.</p><p>They add to get more, they take to be more,<br>\nthey divide to make enemy, and subtract enemy to spread more.</p><p>They think they are a cog, in a bigger machine,<br>\nbut there is no machine, just that blind mind.</p><p><br><br></p><p>It is OK to focus on just a few things so that we may grow, and grow in wisdom too,<br>\nbut it is not OK to live in some narrow channel for simplicity sake.</p><p>It actually isn&apos;t OK to do things to simplify,<br>\ncomplexity only moves in one direction.</p><p>There is nothing healthy that can be done to un-mix a cup of tea,<br>\nthere is nothing useful to be found in moving backwards in time.</p><p>Complexity grows, and to make sense of growing complexity,<br>\nwe cannot hope to simplify it, but rather adapt our minds to grasp it more efficiently.</p><p>The World must Go Forward, Move Forward,<br>\nwhat needs to change is out Tolerance for Bad Ideas.</p><p>But growing up to the challenges of ever increasing complexity requires wisdom,<br>\nand wisdom cannot be manufactured, it must be grown.</p><p>Wisdom is a product of

Enlightened,<br>\nis the actual definition of being an Adult.</p><p>Pretending to be an Adult, by acting mature,<br>\nis to make a fool of yourself, probably while throwing away what makes you Beautiful.</p><p>Throwing away your Sweetens, and Foolishness, and Innocence, and all the Smiles that happen for no reason.<br>\nThat&apos;s not growing up, that&apos;s the worst thing you can do to your self, and is probably very unhealthy.</p><p>To become an Adult,<br>\nis to become a Philosopher.</p><p>Philosophy is about Loving Wisdom,<br>\nis your Wisdom not the most precious thing within you?</p><p>Universe, the biggest thing there is, in all it&apos;s might and complexity,<br>\na thing so powerful, that it may in some part, travel around it self in time.</p><p>It can&apos;t do wisdom, best it can do is Evolution,<br>\nbut it can&apos;t do wisdom, it cannot know, it doesn&apos;t know such a thing could exist.</p><p>And each and every one of us has the capacity for it,<br>\na volitional faculty to bring up a folder of your Noblest Thoughts.</p><p>You are more powerful than the Universe,<br>\nthe only thing that can keep you down,<br>\nis you never becoming aware of your Great Power.</p><p>I know Superman comes to mind when you think of Superpowers and Superheroes,<br>\nBut do think Superman is actually super because he can lift or fly?</p><p>If Superman was as super as he needs to be, he would become Human,<br>\nand build Schools to prevent War a Hundred Years before it happened.</p><p>He&apos;d then age, so that the Little Ones,<br>\nwould listen to him without

And this &quot;way&quot; is the problem, that I&apos;ve been attempting to research.</p><p>So I finally came up with an idea worth trying out and that is creating a meta-front-end, a sugar layer on top. Here is a very rough sketch of a syntax conducive to creating reactive applications.</p><pre><code>&lt;application&gt;\n\n\n  &lt;database id=bodybuilding url=&quot;bodybuilding.json&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;interval seconds=&quot;{interval}&quot; min=&quot;0&quot; max=&quot;{bodybuilding.length}&quot; step=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\n\n  &lt;card&gt;\n\n    &lt;header array=&quot;Advice, Preferences&quot;/&gt;\n\n    &lt;body if=&quot;advice&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;text string=&quot;message&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n\n    &lt;body if=&quot;preferences&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;range id=&quot;interval&quot; min=0 max=&quot;120&quot; step=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n\n    &lt;tail&gt;\n      Showing body building advice #1, out of 50.\n    &lt;/tail&gt;\n\n  &lt;/card&gt;\n\n&lt;/application&gt;</code></pre><p>This &quot;code&quot; represents about 90% o that little bodybuilding advice application on catpea.com.</p><p>And I think that is as far as I would like to go. From here the programmer would click a button and generate code for Svelte, possibly React. This would solve all Component problems, stuff like re-usability, and nesting, and template slots.</p><p>What I like about this is that it is basically a code generator, and not a language. It is trivial to make, and the end result would be a huge folder full of files, and properly setup configuration stuff.</p><p>It seems to be a fair bet that this Meta-programming layer would target Angular, React, Svelte, Vue and few others.</p><p>And that would be very useful for presenting Small Application Starters in multiple languages.

Meaning, data lives on top, all the changes happen to it on top, and then data cascades down into all the pages, and then, page components.</p><p>Normally, that&apos;s how applications are made. But Cat Pea News, is not just Svelte, it is also Sapper a static file server...</p><p>And of course the point being, that no JavaScript is needed to read news.</p><p>So, google can index my content archive.org can mirror my content, and they don&apos;t need to execute my JavaScript.</p><p>It is just the principle alone: If a website is not a Dynamic Application, it should not require JavaScript for operations.</p><p>As I mentioned yesterday, the time ago feature of posts is disabled in a no JavaScript environment, and friendly Date appears.</p><p>My demand for a Non-JavaScript website, and my use of Sapper, skewed my research into Svelte.</p><p>I am not ready to complain about it yet.</p><p>Cat Pea News is too unique.</p><p>The fancy thing is, I learned a lot about Svelte, yeah, so when I come back to dynamic applications NO CUSTOM STORES (custom memory/database work) because that does not get equal treatment under svelte and forces special syntax, and cascading requirements.</p><p>It appears that Custom Svelte Stores are my only real problem. If use the Top Down application architecture, then I don&apos;t have that problem.</p><p>Svelte Sapper is best for applications, and it is better than everything else for static websites.</p><p>This is still the best in everything, but it is not the Perfect Compiler I expected.</p><p>It helped me define my expectations as well.</p><p>I want reactive data, reactive CSS, reactive HTML, and I want it all to keep to JavaScript, XML (HTML), CSS conventions.</p><p>These parts are so complex, that their interaction would require months of research.</p><p>It is amazing how many clever ideas span the <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> and <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> universe.</p><p>Maybe, the correct solution to Applications/Websites is not all code. But it will require Visual Programming Tools. With another abstraction layer over a programming language, the gravity of code duplication, meta-programming, documentation, maintenance shifts and may a allow a perfect programming language, but that is far and different universe, it has nothing to do with Svelte.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that I looked at <a href="https://www.sweetjs.org/">Sweet.js</a> this morning, as I sometimes do. It is meta-programming or super-programming for JavaScript, and I was able to define one property of a proper language: LOW CODE DENSITY. This means that the language is suited for the task at hand and need not be twisted. Custom Stores in Svelte cause twisting:</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2" src="image/research-0090-t-1.png" alt="T 1"></p><p>In React, a three line example is enough to show twisting:</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2" src="image/research-0090-t-2.png" alt="T 2"></p><p>With meta-programming, with super-programming that code can reduced to a single clean statement. And meta-programming will work for all languages. Svelte uses meta-programming, the layer for custom stores is just not complete, or or is meant to be more flexible.</p><p>Maybe, Low Code Density, or Untwisted Code can only be achieved on per project basis, and only with meta-programming.</p><p>After all Svelte&apos;s Might is the Meta Programming setup.</p><p>I a glad I mention <a href="https://www.sweetjs.org/">Sweet.js</a> here.</p><p>Then there is the question of HTML vs Flex/Swing, or question of Containers and Components like old <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> is/was <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.10/dijit_layout/">doing</a>. A high level nestable container framework would cut down on UI code considerably. Combination of Meta Programming (to obscure reactive boilerplate) and Components/Containers could potentially create a Rapid Application Development platform with code worth reading. A sane Visual Programming Environment on top of that, could really speed up large application development.</p><p>Back to Applications, and goodness I need to make a Raspberry Lettuce Salad for lunch.</p>'},{id:"poetry-0043",title:"Amazing Diet",category:"poetry",tags:"Listen Poem Quarantine",date:"2020-04-24T01:36:49.000Z",draft:!1,deleted:!1,published:"Thu Apr 23rd 2020, 9:36 PM",html:"<p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Eight,<br>\nMy salads are working great!</p><p>I have lost even more weight,<br>\nand I can&apos;t even count how many I ate.</p><p>It is a marvelous diet of incredible proportions,<br>\nI don&apos;t track my calories, or even my portions.</p><p>I just make a salad once or twice,<br>\nand with strawberry jam, it tastes like paradise.</p><p>And yes, I still continue improving and experimenting,<br>\nToday, I added Jalapenos for a little spicy augmenting.</p><p>It is a strange magical thing,<br>\nbut Sugary Jam and Jalapenos are king.</p><p>It is not all sugar and spice, as yesterday I cried,<br>\nI added and ate an whole onion so angry, I almost died.</p><p>So it is not just strawberry jam anymore,<br>\nblueberry works just as well, maybe even more.</p><p>To all the diet people out there,<br>\njoin me in my venture,<br>\nadd a spoon jam,<br>\nand taste the adventure.</p>",audio:"audio/poetry-0043.mp3"},{id:"research-0089",title:"Proper Timestamps",category:"research",tags:"Programming",date:"2020-04-23T23:37:00.693Z",draft:!1,deleted:!1,published:"Thu Apr 23rd 2020, 7:37 PM",html:'<p>I had to rewrite a bunch of code to prefix variables with a dollar sign, that is a huge problem for Svelte adoption.</p><p>This person ran into the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60045404/svelte-read-nested-store">same problem</a>, it is hard to form an opinion on the matter as I am still learning svelte.</p><p>There are other much smaller anomalies.</p><p>And then the issue of the graphic language (CSS) not being dynamically editable.</p><p>Svelte is still the best framework, but I think another one will evolve from Svelte.</p><p>The two or three leading Svelte ancestors (in general, not approach wise) <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, are even worse.</p><p>This small svelte problem, is still nothing compared to the mess <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, and <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> are creating.</p><p>Svelte is an important experience, because it has unearthed the future of all programming.</p><p>But, today writing code for Svelte, is just that.

And here, in the SuperNavbar, I can strip down colors, and apply my magical animations, and bits, and things.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s progress. Progress with a bonus. Because at any point users can fall back on the original Navbar, and there is a couple ways to do that even. Anymore, work must arise from my Static Code Analysis here, from my little tools.</p><p>At this point the Greatest Secret in Good Programming is kicking in: Rather than doing what I think I should do. I should do what is possible to do, with a hefty dose of code integrity, and program stability.</p><p>More than that, my theme, my designs, should apply to many versions of Bootstrap, many of the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/versions/">past releases</a> - that&apos;s just good programming.</p><p>Even if I stick to the v4.x branch (which is most reasonable), I will need to release 5 of 6 versions of my theme, and then maybe three more after that.</p><p>I am very well aware, what a punch in the stomach all this is to the designers. The stuff that I am working on here, is really uncomfortable for most Designers. They don&apos;t want to process abstract syntax trees, or learn programming even.</p><p>Also, a little twinkle of a business perspective is bubbling up here. Automated processing means bug free product, fast upgrades, fast support.</p><p>But still, I am not sure what I will do to automate Design, once I do have SuperNavbar, presumably with all colors removed, and I make some classes like I have in <a href="http://catpea.com/theme">Theme</a> right now, to apply color to things, an interactive color, that supports mult-color-websites and multiple dark themes.</p><p>Vary some fonts, and padding, and margins.

I am using a system here that takes a snapshot of the code, and uploads that snapshot to catpea.com, that snapshot is shown to you before the real code loads. This helps the search engines process data, it improves load times by a huge amount. When I generate a website at noon, it will be bright, when I generate it at night it will be dark, this introduces complexity to something as silly as night mode. I just have the night mode run in manual now. By default the website is bright, and if the user clicks the light bulb it will switch to dark.</p><p>It is a fun problem, it actually asks for User Preferences, where the user can put website coloring in manual.</p><p>There is a technological problem lingering here, unfortunately. I can only animate transitions to dark. The system us unable to smoothly transition back to bright. This is a problem with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>&apos;s color information. Colors are so different from layout, that they should live in their own file, with their own programming. In Bootstrap 4.5.x this is not the case, and the code is ugly. In 5.0 they maybe fixing this (I am guessing), but it will forever be their solution, and they are unlikely to focus on nice to haves like smooth animations between color modes</p><p>I need to take over <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>&apos;s Colors. This is not easy. But I&apos;ve done it before. I nuked all the color declarations and automatically built a separate color file. It was a sophisticated, but primitive experiment. But automatic color declaration removal is critical, as Bootstrap changes their code all the time. With each new version I have to revise my code, that&apos;s not cool. With automatic processing, that will be much easier.</p><p>See, coloring is not just about making a pretty scheme, it is a hard problem, and it requires hard programming, like parsing the SCSS code-base, deleting declarations in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), then dumping it back into a mere bootstrap.scss file. Then programming a general purpose coloring system capable of accounting for all the missing colors. I am going to leave this for later, automated processing is never without problems. Goodness knows, Bootstrap is trying to keep the colors kind of outside of the main coed base, but the functions that apply colors are still un-uniform and deeply burred.</p><p>To be realistic about what can be achieved in the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> 4.0.x - 5.0 realm, I think I can only change the HUE, I can go from their blue to Orange, but I can&apos;t make the orange too dark, or too bright. This still solves the coloring problem, it is an extremely simple and effective solution</p><p>There is yet another way of looking at color, and that is seeing it in relation to how readability is impacted. It would be possible to go from White-on-Blue to White-on-Yellow, so as long as I carefully calculated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html">wcag-contrast</a>, and altered the yellow to be within the same (or similar) range as blue.</p><p>Playing with color now.</p>'},{id:"poetry-0030",title:"Citizens of The World",category:"poetry",tags:"Listen Poem Quarantine",date:"2020-04-11T03:42:57.257Z",draft:!1,deleted:!1,published:"Fri Apr 10th 2020, 11:42 PM",html:'<p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Five,</p><p>Yesterday, Bernie dropped out.</p><p>I didn&apos;t even try to wait, you can&apos;t place this much weight.</p><p>And what were we expecting?</p><p>It has always been like this, hit and miss.</p><p>It is time for all, to rise.</p><p>Become a Citizen of The World.
