And this &quot;way&quot; is the problem, that I&apos;ve been attempting to research.</p><p>So I finally came up with an idea worth trying out and that is creating a meta-front-end, a sugar layer on top. Here is a very rough sketch of a syntax conducive to creating reactive applications.</p><pre><code>&lt;application&gt;\n\n\n  &lt;database id=bodybuilding url=&quot;bodybuilding.json&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;interval seconds=&quot;{interval}&quot; min=&quot;0&quot; max=&quot;{bodybuilding.length}&quot; step=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\n\n  &lt;card&gt;\n\n    &lt;header array=&quot;Advice, Preferences&quot;/&gt;\n\n    &lt;body if=&quot;advice&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;text string=&quot;message&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n\n    &lt;body if=&quot;preferences&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;range id=&quot;interval&quot; min=0 max=&quot;120&quot; step=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n\n    &lt;tail&gt;\n      Showing body building advice #1, out of 50.\n    &lt;/tail&gt;\n\n  &lt;/card&gt;\n\n&lt;/application&gt;</code></pre><p>This &quot;code&quot; represents about 90% o that little bodybuilding advice application on catpea.com.</p><p>And I think that is as far as I would like to go. From here the programmer would click a button and generate code for Svelte, possibly React. This would solve all Component problems, stuff like re-usability, and nesting, and template slots.</p><p>What I like about this is that it is basically a code generator, and not a language.

It is meta-programming or super-programming for JavaScript, and I was able to define one property of a proper language: LOW CODE DENSITY. This means that the language is suited for the task at hand and need not be twisted. Custom Stores in Svelte cause twisting:</p><p><img class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2" src="image/research-0090-t-1.png" alt="T 1"></p><p>In React, a three line example is enough to show twisting:</p><p><img class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2" src="image/research-0090-t-2.png" alt="T 2"></p><p>With meta-programming, with super-programming that code can reduced to a single clean statement. And meta-programming will work for all languages. Svelte uses meta-programming, the layer for custom stores is just not complete, or or is meant to be more flexible.</p><p>Maybe, Low Code Density, or Untwisted Code can only be achieved on per project basis, and only with meta-programming.</p><p>After all Svelte&apos;s Might is the Meta Programming setup.</p><p>I a glad I mention <a href="https://www.sweetjs.org/">Sweet.js</a> here.</p><p>Then there is the question of HTML vs Flex/Swing, or question of Containers and Components like old <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> is/was <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.10/dijit_layout/">doing</a>. A high level nestable container framework would cut down on UI code considerably. Combination of Meta Programming (to obscure reactive boilerplate) and Components/Containers could potentially create a Rapid Application Development platform with code worth reading. A sane Visual Programming Environment on top of that, could really speed up large application development.</p><p>Back to Applications, and goodness I need to make a Raspberry Lettuce Salad for lunch.</p>'},{id:"poetry-0043",title:"Amazing Diet",category:"poetry",tags:"Listen Poem Quarantine",date:"2020-04-24T01:36:49.000Z",draft:!1,deleted:!1,published:"Thu Apr 23rd 2020, 9:36 PM",html:"<p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Eight,<br>\nMy salads are working great!</p><p>I have lost even more weight,<br>\nand I can&apos;t even count how many I ate.</p><p>It is a marvelous diet of incredible proportions,<br>\nI don&apos;t track my calories, or even my portions.</p><p>I just make a salad once or twice,<br>\nand with strawberry jam, it tastes like paradise.</p><p>And yes, I still continue improving and experimenting,<br>\nToday, I added Jalapenos for a little spicy augmenting.</p><p>It is a strange magical thing,<br>\nbut Sugary Jam and Jalapenos are king.</p><p>It is not all sugar and spice, as yesterday I cried,<br>\nI added and ate an whole onion so angry, I almost died.</p><p>So it is not just strawberry jam anymore,<br>\nblueberry works just as well, maybe even more.</p><p>To all the diet people out there,<br>\njoin me in my venture,<br>\nadd a spoon jam,<br>\nand taste the adventure.</p>",audio:"audio/poetry-0043.mp3"},{id:"research-0089",title:"Proper Timestamps",category:"research",tags:"Programming",date:"2020-04-23T23:37:00.693Z",draft:!1,deleted:!1,published:"Thu Apr 23rd 2020, 7:37 PM",html:'<p>I had to rewrite a bunch of code to prefix variables with a dollar sign, that is a huge problem for Svelte adoption.</p><p>This person ran into the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60045404/svelte-read-nested-store">same problem</a>, it is hard to form an opinion on the matter as I am still learning svelte.</p><p>There are other much smaller anomalies.</p><p>And then the issue of the graphic language (CSS) not being dynamically editable.</p><p>Svelte is still the best framework, but I think another one will evolve from Svelte.</p><p>The two or three leading Svelte ancestors (in general, not approach wise) <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, are even worse.</p><p>This small svelte problem, is still nothing compared to the mess <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, and <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> are creating.</p><p>Svelte is an important experience, because it has unearthed the future of all programming.</p><p>But, today writing code for Svelte, is just that.

All those little boxes, little menus, little drawers, bits of Music Making, Bodybuilding Advice, all of that are snippets of code that will make this theme sell.

I should do what is possible to do, with a hefty dose of code integrity, and program stability.</p><p>More than that, my theme, my designs, should apply to many versions of Bootstrap, many of the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/versions/">past releases</a> - that&apos;s just good programming.</p><p>Even if I stick to the v4.x branch (which is most reasonable), I will need to release 5 of 6 versions of my theme, and then maybe three more after that.</p><p>I am very well aware, what a punch in the stomach all this is to the designers. The stuff that I am working on here, is really uncomfortable for most Designers. They don&apos;t want to process abstract syntax trees, or learn programming even.</p><p>Also, a little twinkle of a business perspective is bubbling up here. Automated processing means bug free product, fast upgrades, fast support.</p><p>But still, I am not sure what I will do to automate Design, once I do have SuperNavbar, presumably with all colors removed, and I make some classes like I have in <a href="http://catpea.com/theme">Theme</a> right now, to apply color to things, an interactive color, that supports mult-color-websites and multiple dark themes.</p><p>Vary some fonts, and padding, and margins.

I am using a system here that takes a snapshot of the code, and uploads that snapshot to catpea.com, that snapshot is shown to you before the real code loads. This helps the search engines process data, it improves load times by a huge amount. When I generate a website at noon, it will be bright, when I generate it at night it will be dark, this introduces complexity to something as silly as night mode. I just have the night mode run in manual now. By default the website is bright, and if the user clicks the light bulb it will switch to dark.</p><p>It is a fun problem, it actually asks for User Preferences, where the user can put website coloring in manual.</p><p>There is a technological problem lingering here, unfortunately. I can only animate transitions to dark. The system us unable to smoothly transition back to bright. This is a problem with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>&apos;s color information. Colors are so different from layout, that they should live in their own file, with their own programming. In Bootstrap 4.5.x this is not the case, and the code is ugly. In 5.0 they maybe fixing this (I am guessing), but it will forever be their solution, and they are unlikely to focus on nice to haves like smooth animations between color modes</p><p>I need to take over <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>&apos;s Colors. This is not easy. But I&apos;ve done it before. I nuked all the color declarations and automatically built a separate color file. It was a sophisticated, but primitive experiment. But automatic color declaration removal is critical, as Bootstrap changes their code all the time. With each new version I have to revise my code, that&apos;s not cool. With automatic processing, that will be much easier.</p><p>See, coloring is not just about making a pretty scheme, it is a hard problem, and it requires hard programming, like parsing the SCSS code-base, deleting declarations in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), then dumping it back into a mere bootstrap.scss file. Then programming a general purpose coloring system capable of accounting for all the missing colors. I am going to leave this for later, automated processing is never without problems. Goodness knows, Bootstrap is trying to keep the colors kind of outside of the main coed base, but the functions that apply colors are still un-uniform and deeply burred.</p><p>To be realistic about what can be achieved in the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> 4.0.x - 5.0 realm, I think I can only change the HUE, I can go from their blue to Orange, but I can&apos;t make the orange too dark, or too bright. This still solves the coloring problem, it is an extremely simple and effective solution</p><p>There is yet another way of looking at color, and that is seeing it in relation to how readability is impacted. It would be possible to go from White-on-Blue to White-on-Yellow, so as long as I carefully calculated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html">wcag-contrast</a>, and altered the yellow to be within the same (or similar) range as blue.</p><p>Playing with color now.</p>'},{id:"poetry-0030",title:"Citizens of The World",category:"poetry",tags:"Listen Poem Quarantine",date:"2020-04-11T03:42:57.257Z",draft:!1,deleted:!1,published:"Fri Apr 10th 2020, 11:42 PM",html:'<p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Five,</p><p>Yesterday, Bernie dropped out.</p><p>I didn&apos;t even try to wait, you can&apos;t place this much weight.</p><p>And what were we expecting?</p><p>It has always been like this, hit and miss.</p><p>It is time for all, to rise.</p><p>Become a Citizen of The World.

The <a href="https://github.com/fantasyui-com/catpea-com/tree/master/src/style/drawer">drawer page</a> shows examples of how to use the Drawer, that language is called HTML. <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> developers would frown on my work thus far because the drawer component can almost be made in another way, they actually have similar things. But I am thinking about creating components for a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Digital+Audio+Workstation&amp;tbm=isch">Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)</a> like <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/">Ableton</a>, right now the drawer is not impressive, but it will evolve beyond what Bootstrap can do. Already I am thinking that I should not use colors, but rather transparent shadows, so whatever color is in the background the drawer will inherit it automatically. <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> creates flat/raised things, and my additions may end up being graphically sunken. Plus, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> creates structure, and I use it for layout and containers. They don&apos;t really create content that is specific for some purpose (like my DAW), they limit themselves to general purpose things. They do sell themes, and if I ever completed this project, they may accept mine into their store. I have much more to learn, and I still have to get used to their way of doing things.</p>'},{id:"poetry-0019",title:"Lawn Flurries",category:"poetry",tags:"Poem Quarantine",date:"2020-03-30T13:11:22.278Z",draft:!1,deleted:!1,published:"Mon Mar 30th 2020, 9:11 AM",html:"<p>Captain&apos;s Log: Day Fourteen of Quarantine,</p><p>All the local squirrels, now hold me in high esteem.</p><p>They feel munchies to extreme,</p><p>but the trailmix they stole is gone,</p><p>flurries of the box still scattered on my lawn.</p><p>Squirrels, now crazed, and withdrawn.</p><p>Peanuts on their mind,</p><p>because mail delivery was ill timed.</p><p>Why am I like this?</p>"},{id:"research-0021",title:"Added A Collapsible Panel To The Shebang Slash Beat Sequencer It Looks Good Works Ok I Will Need To Do A Lot Of Configuration...",category:"research",tags:"Programming",date:"2020-03-30T00:37:57.352Z",draft:!1,deleted:!1,published:"Sun Mar 29th 2020, 8:37 PM",html:'<p>Added a collapsible panel to the Shebang Slash Beat Sequencer.
