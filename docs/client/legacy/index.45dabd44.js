For example Saturation of 0.5 in JavaScript, means the same thing that Saturation of 0.5 in Sass. But they each have a different way of expressing that.

And here, in the SuperNavbar, I can strip down colors, and apply my magical animations, and bits, and things.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#39;s progress. Progress with a bonus. Because at any point users can fall back on the original Navbar, and there is a couple ways to do that even. Anymore, work must arise from my Static Code Analysis here, from my little tools.</p>\n<p>At this point the Greatest Secret in Good Programming is kicking in: Rather than doing what I think I should do. I should do what is possible to do, with a hefty dose of code integrity, and program stability.</p>\n<p>More than that, my theme, my designs, should apply to many versions of Bootstrap, many of the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/versions/">past releases</a> - that&#39;s just good programming.</p>\n<p>Even if I stick to the v4.x branch (which is most reasonable), I will need to release 5 of 6 versions of my theme, and then maybe three more after that.</p>\n<p>I am very well aware, what a punch in the stomach all this is to the designers. The stuff that I am working on here, is really uncomfortable for most Designers. They don&#39;t want to process abstract syntax trees, or learn programming even.</p>\n<p>Also, a little twinkle of a business perspective is bubbling up here. Automated processing means bug free product, fast upgrades, fast support.</p>\n<p>But still, I am not sure what I will do to automate Design, once I do have SuperNavbar, presumably with all colors removed, and I make some classes like I have in <a href="/theme">Theme</a> right now, to apply color to things, an interactive color, that supports mult-color-websites and multiple dark themes.</p>\n<p>Vary some fonts, and padding, and margins.

I am using a system here that takes a snapshot of the code, and uploads that snapshot to catpea.com, that snapshot is shown to you before the real code loads. This helps the search engines process data, it improves load times by a huge amount. When I generate a website at noon, it will be bright, when I generate it at night it will be dark, this introduces complexity to something as silly as night mode. I just have the night mode run in manual now. By default the website is bright, and if the user clicks the light bulb it will switch to dark.</p>\n<p>It is a fun problem, it actually asks for User Preferences, where the user can put website coloring in manual.</p>\n<p>There is a technological problem lingering here, unfortunately. I can only animate transitions to dark. The system us unable to smoothly transition back to bright. This is a problem with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>&#39;s color information. Colors are so different from layout, that they should live in their own file, with their own programming. In Bootstrap 4.5.x this is not the case, and the code is ugly. In 5.0 they maybe fixing this (I am guessing), but it will forever be their solution, and they are unlikely to focus on nice to haves like smooth animations between color modes</p>\n<p>I need to take over <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>&#39;s Colors. This is not easy. But I&#39;ve done it before. I nuked all the color declarations and automatically built a separate color file. It was a sophisticated, but primitive experiment. But automatic color declaration removal is critical, as Bootstrap changes their code all the time. With each new version I have to revise my code, that&#39;s not cool. With automatic processing, that will be much easier.</p>\n<p>See, coloring is not just about making a pretty scheme, it is a hard problem, and it requires hard programming, like parsing the SCSS code-base, deleting declarations in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), then dumping it back into a mere bootstrap.scss file. Then programming a general purpose coloring system capable of accounting for all the missing colors. I am going to leave this for later, automated processing is never without problems. Goodness knows, Bootstrap is trying to keep the colors kind of outside of the main coed base, but the functions that apply colors are still un-uniform and deeply burred.</p>\n<p>To be realistic about what can be achieved in the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> 4.0.x - 5.0 realm, I think I can only change the HUE, I can go from their blue to Orange, but I can&#39;t make the orange too dark, or too bright. This still solves the coloring problem, it is an extremely simple and effective solution</p>\n<p>There is yet another way of looking at color, and that is seeing it in relation to how readability is impacted.

The point is that the text is keeping up with the background, it is keeping juuuuuuust a wee bit above, un-readability.</p>\n<p><img class="img-fluid" src="research/smart-color.png" alt="GUI Ideas"></p>\n<p>Automatic Coloring</p>\n<p>As a side-note, programming-wise this is not really impressive, it is like 5 lines of code, so pro-programmers would yawn at this, but it is a big deal for me, because I am getting really precise and delicate control over colors in my Dark Theme here, that it is only 5 lines of code, is great for me, I can just type in a bit of code and be done with worrying about color readability for some UI component or button/label combo.
