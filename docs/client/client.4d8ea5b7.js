And this &quot;way&quot; is the problem, that I&apos;ve been attempting to research.</p><p>So I finally came up with an idea worth trying out and that is creating a meta-front-end, a sugar layer on top. Here is a very rough sketch of a syntax conducive to creating reactive applications.</p><pre><code>&lt;application&gt;\n\n\n  &lt;database id=bodybuilding url=&quot;bodybuilding.json&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;interval seconds=&quot;{interval}&quot; min=&quot;0&quot; max=&quot;{bodybuilding.length}&quot; step=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\n\n  &lt;card&gt;\n\n    &lt;header array=&quot;Advice, Preferences&quot;/&gt;\n\n    &lt;body if=&quot;advice&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;text string=&quot;message&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n\n    &lt;body if=&quot;preferences&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;range id=&quot;interval&quot; min=0 max=&quot;120&quot; step=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n\n    &lt;tail&gt;\n      Showing body building advice #1, out of 50.\n    &lt;/tail&gt;\n\n  &lt;/card&gt;\n\n&lt;/application&gt;</code></pre><p>This &quot;code&quot; represents about 90% o that little bodybuilding advice application on catpea.com.</p><p>And I think that is as far as I would like to go. From here the programmer would click a button and generate code for Svelte, possibly React. This would solve all Component problems, stuff like re-usability, and nesting, and template slots.</p><p>What I like about this is that it is basically a code generator, and not a language. It is trivial to make, and the end result would be a huge folder full of files, and properly setup configuration stuff.</p><p>It seems to be a fair bet that this Meta-programming layer would target Angular, React, Svelte, Vue and few others.</p><p>And that would be very useful for presenting Small Application Starters in multiple languages. Here I am thinking about Bootstrap Themes, again.</p><p>Anyhow, this solves my only problem with Reactive Programming, lack of a fast programmable front-end language.

But it will require Visual Programming Tools. With another abstraction layer over a programming language, the gravity of code duplication, meta-programming, documentation, maintenance shifts and may a allow a perfect programming language, but that is far and different universe, it has nothing to do with Svelte.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that I looked at <a href="https://www.sweetjs.org/">Sweet.js</a> this morning, as I sometimes do. It is meta-programming or super-programming for JavaScript, and I was able to define one property of a proper language: LOW CODE DENSITY. This means that the language is suited for the task at hand and need not be twisted. Custom Stores in Svelte cause twisting:</p><p><img class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2" src="image/research-0090-t-1.png" alt="T 1"></p><p>In React, a three line example is enough to show twisting:</p><p><img class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2" src="image/research-0090-t-2.png" alt="T 2"></p><p>With meta-programming, with super-programming that code can reduced to a single clean statement. And meta-programming will work for all languages. Svelte uses meta-programming, the layer for custom stores is just not complete, or or is meant to be more flexible.</p><p>Maybe, Low Code Density, or Untwisted Code can only be achieved on per project basis, and only with meta-programming.</p><p>After all Svelte&apos;s Might is the Meta Programming setup.</p><p>I a glad I mention <a href="https://www.sweetjs.org/">Sweet.js</a> here.</p><p>Then there is the question of HTML vs Flex/Swing, or question of Containers and Components like old <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> is/was <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.10/dijit_layout/">doing</a>. A high level nestable container framework would cut down on UI code considerably. Combination of Meta Programming (to obscure reactive boilerplate) and Components/Containers could potentially create a Rapid Application Development platform with code worth reading. A sane Visual Programming Environment on top of that, could really speed up large application development.</p><p>Back to Applications, and goodness I need to make a Raspberry Lettuce Salad for lunch.</p>'},{id:"poetry-0043",title:"Amazing Diet",category:"poetry",tags:"Listen Poem Quarantine",date:"2020-04-24T01:36:49.000Z",draft:!1,deleted:!1,published:"Thu Apr 23rd 2020, 9:36 PM",html:"<p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Eight,<br>\nMy salads are working great!</p><p>I have lost even more weight,<br>\nand I can&apos;t even count how many I ate.</p><p>It is a marvelous diet of incredible proportions,<br>\nI don&apos;t track my calories, or even my portions.</p><p>I just make a salad once or twice,<br>\nand with strawberry jam, it tastes like paradise.</p><p>And yes, I still continue improving and experimenting,<br>\nToday, I added Jalapenos for a little spicy augmenting.</p><p>It is a strange magical thing,<br>\nbut Sugary Jam and Jalapenos are king.</p><p>It is not all sugar and spice, as yesterday I cried,<br>\nI added and ate an whole onion so angry, I almost died.</p><p>So it is not just strawberry jam anymore,<br>\nblueberry works just as well, maybe even more.</p><p>To all the diet people out there,<br>\njoin me in my venture,<br>\nadd a spoon jam,<br>\nand taste the adventure.</p>",audio:"audio/poetry-0043.mp3"},{id:"research-0089",title:"Proper Timestamps",category:"research",tags:"Programming",date:"2020-04-23T23:37:00.693Z",draft:!1,deleted:!1,published:"Thu Apr 23rd 2020, 7:37 PM",html:'<p>I had to rewrite a bunch of code to prefix variables with a dollar sign, that is a huge problem for Svelte adoption.</p><p>This person ran into the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60045404/svelte-read-nested-store">same problem</a>, it is hard to form an opinion on the matter as I am still learning svelte.</p><p>There are other much smaller anomalies.</p><p>And then the issue of the graphic language (CSS) not being dynamically editable.</p><p>Svelte is still the best framework, but I think another one will evolve from Svelte.</p><p>The two or three leading Svelte ancestors (in general, not approach wise) <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, are even worse.</p><p>This small svelte problem, is still nothing compared to the mess <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, and <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> are creating.</p><p>Svelte is an important experience, because it has unearthed the future of all programming.</p><p>But, today writing code for Svelte, is just that.

Moreover, Svelte already compiles to WebComponents, and WebComponents will forever lack (by default) a good automatic data to UI updates, because they are not designed to make programming reasonable, unlike Svelte.</p><p>These important Theme-Extras therefore, must be written in Svelte. And Cat Pea, is a prime example of what an Extra would look like. All those little boxes, little menus, little drawers, bits of Music Making, Bodybuilding Advice, all of that are snippets of code that will make this theme sell. The news site, is not a good snippet, it should be included, but it is too monolithic, it is just buttons for browsing posts.</p><p>I will need to redesign Cat Pea with that in mind, so my programming adventure is also making a tiny product for <a href="https://themes.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap Themes</a>. Anyhow, here are the newly added UI improvements.</p><p>Here is the new Home Page, it looks like an App, because the user is browsing All Posts at first. I think it would be better to create a Home Page that first opens to 5 latest posts, and I may do that later.</p><p><img class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2" src="image/research-0086-news-update-1.png" alt="News Update 1"></p><p>This is Category View, it is a lot cleaner, but it is very busy.

I&apos;ll have toggle tat off into a mini miniature, I&apos;d like to see just the post here, I&apos;ll add a &quot;Quick Nav&quot; box and when that&apos;s opened the quick navigation features will show up. Reading a post should just be about a post.</p><p>I like the Listen button, and I like the fact that it fits well on the home page.</p><p><img class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5 mb-2" src="image/research-0086-news-update-3.png" alt="News Update 3"></p><p>The one big change is that there is no more Player, the user has to click the button to see it. This is because every browser has it&apos;s own player.

I am using a system here that takes a snapshot of the code, and uploads that snapshot to catpea.com, that snapshot is shown to you before the real code loads. This helps the search engines process data, it improves load times by a huge amount. When I generate a website at noon, it will be bright, when I generate it at night it will be dark, this introduces complexity to something as silly as night mode. I just have the night mode run in manual now. By default the website is bright, and if the user clicks the light bulb it will switch to dark.</p><p>It is a fun problem, it actually asks for User Preferences, where the user can put website coloring in manual.</p><p>There is a technological problem lingering here, unfortunately. I can only animate transitions to dark. The system us unable to smoothly transition back to bright. This is a problem with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>&apos;s color information. Colors are so different from layout, that they should live in their own file, with their own programming. In Bootstrap 4.5.x this is not the case, and the code is ugly.

This is not easy. But I&apos;ve done it before. I nuked all the color declarations and automatically built a separate color file. It was a sophisticated, but primitive experiment. But automatic color declaration removal is critical, as Bootstrap changes their code all the time. With each new version I have to revise my code, that&apos;s not cool. With automatic processing, that will be much easier.</p><p>See, coloring is not just about making a pretty scheme, it is a hard problem, and it requires hard programming, like parsing the SCSS code-base, deleting declarations in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), then dumping it back into a mere bootstrap.scss file. Then programming a general purpose coloring system capable of accounting for all the missing colors. I am going to leave this for later, automated processing is never without problems.
