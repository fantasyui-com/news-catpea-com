class=ml-3><p><p>We are not Island Universes scattered to no end in some void,<br> we are a part of a growing civilization with a past and a future.<p>And we might have become confused about the Scope of Our Existence,<br> we stand divided by borders and committed to repeating history's mistakes.<p>It is unwise to pretend to be able to handle a great responsibility,<br> only desperation, fractures, and exploitation by other desperate pretenders can follow.<p>Those who are granted authority are often not wise enough to handle it,<br> and in their mediocrity they commit what in larger scope translates to real Crimes Against Humanity.<p>There cannot be wisdom without understanding and inheriting from past generations,<br> the transfer of knowledge occurs by means of Understanding Books.<p>And there cannot be understanding without Authenticity,<br> in haste of chasing a career there can only be memorization and misunderstanding.<p>We must keep in mind; that what the future generations do not perceive as clear progress,<br> will be seen as the continuation of dark ages with authorities on the wrong side of history.<p>The World United, is not a fairy-tale, nor should it be a mere dream for us,<br> but a Gift of Peace for The Future Generations, so that they may grow in Dignity, Health, and Wisdom.<p>We are neither disconnected from the future generations, nor the past generations,<br> we are a stepping stone in the development of The Human Kind.<p>And we should recognize this Great Honor and Reward,<br> and understand that the larger context is found in helping to build a better world for future generations.<p>All our decisions, across all levels and authorities,<br> Police, Attorneys and Judges, Parents, Teachers and Principals, Mayors, Governors, Prime Misters and Presidents, and everybody else...<p>Must be mindful of future generations, of a growing world, of making lasting and meaningful contributions to the entire human kind,<br> a World that will eventually become united and free of borders.<p>A world with future generations that will look back at us,<br> right now, right here, with questions that we must present answers to.<p>We are getting stuck in circles,<br> because people are forgetting history's lessons.<p>Because we are not thinking on a large enough scale,<br> we end up building more prisons rather than ending poverty with meaningful prevention programs.<p>Endless cycles of heartless poverty that freeze the best of us,<br> poverty that wouldn't even be a feature of modern society had we in our wisdom recognized it for what it is.<p>Poverty denies people food and well being,<br> causes stress and great harm to mind and body.<p>Love above Law, before we allow the practice of law,<br> we must end the cycles of poverty.<p>Money must not be used to limit people,<br> it is meant to help.<p>And how can a culture be to fail to see, how a young person allowed to build a business without the threat of homelessness and starvation,<br> will contribute back to the city and everyone's well being.<p>What is so hard about seeing that rather than sending non-violent criminals to prison,<br> we can prevent their biggest mistakes by putting an end to their worries of sleeping hungry on the street.<p><br><br><p>Any time, we fail to keep to reality,<br> be it sending a 15 year old lady to prison, or denying science, or tolerating arrests by obscured or unidentified agencies, or abuses of power or discretion.<p>We create fractures and distrust,<br> blindly defacing and destroying work of many much wiser great beings, who gave their best trusting that we can carry on, in wisdom.<p>We must not move against the grain of reality,<br> any and all divergence will only create a cascade of fractures that will demand constant attention<br> and result in nothing more than systems that merely stand to support themselves and as an affront to justice and future generations.<p>Where there was once a solution as clear as helping children to inherit the wisdom of their elders,<br> we now see the emergence of a failed and impotent educational system with a mass incarceration backed.<p>Wisdom and inheritance of knowledge cannot be replaced by a "fake it until you make it" trickery,<br> the work of great beings must not be stained by people who fail to see their vision.<p><br><br><p>Once again, the world grows a generation at a time,<br> the education of the teenagers from 20 years ago is currently influencing the state of the world.<p>Likewise, how we treat out children today,<br> will have a monumental impact on the world 20 years from now.<p><br><br><p>Let us honor our children and all the future generations by encouraging them to books,<br> by reminding them of the Great Power of Thinking Beings, of Philosophers and Lovers of Wisdom.<p>By reminding them that their Pursuit of Excellence,<br> can only make the world a better place for us all, and even those that are yet to come.<p>Let us remind them that Books (and now Audio Books) serve as a wonderful source of our wisdom,<br> especially when read in a sequence that fits them best, and understood at thier own pace.<p><br><br><p>Let us remind each other that we must reject short thinking and shortest paths,<br> that do not help the world grow and keep us divided.<p>Let us break out of that selfish endless loop of repeating mistakes of past generations,<br> by working towards a better world a more united world where we recognize each other as One Family.<p><br><br><p>And let us remember that the great and wise beings of past generations,<br> demand that we honor hard won triumphs and do not repeat history's mistakes.<p>The very nature of that demand requires that once we take to wisdom,<br> we must stop following orders, and begin thinking, evaluating, and judging for ourselves.<p>To honor triumphs and guard against heartbreaking mistakes,<br> is the duty we hold to those who came before us,<br> and all the future generations that are yet to follow.<p><br><br><p>As children we are asked to listen and follow,<br> as we grow we must learn to Lead and become Unbreakable.<p>It is not just the challenges of life that will test us,<br> we must also think and evaluate and reject that which is wrong.<p><br><br><p>We are constantly made to listen and expected to follow,<br> look behind any protest, or scandal, or angry headline.<p>We must judge all the contradictory information for ourselves,<br> and make an informed decision as to whether or not majority is correct.<p><br><br><p>Life will always challenge us,<br> and My Goodness - times are always changing.<p>Humanity is constantly bettering her self,<br> what used to be acceptable - may now, be an affront to justice.<p>And while there isn't enough time to comprehend all the books,<br> there is plenty of time to be come a Loving and Wise Compassionate Human Being,<p>Let us remember that we are a chain-link between the Hard Work of Past Generations,<br> and the United, Free from Poverty, and Peaceful Word of <strong>Future</strong> Generations.<p>We are One Growing Family, and that is the correct context for local, state, and federal levels, for all legal and administrative decision making,<br> to diverge from this reality is to get stuck in an endless loop of repeating history's mistakes, the very thing that the past generations are asking us not to do.<p></div> <hr class="border-info my-5"></div></div> <div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-xxl-6 offset-md-1 offset-xxl-3"><nav aria-label="Post
