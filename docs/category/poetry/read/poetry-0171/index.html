not good enough.<p>How many teachers tried to tell their students that they are bad at learning,<br> and how many children became convinced of that, that they are not smart?<p>Where truth is, that we are all equally capable,<br> all capable of genius so as long as it is real kind and not the "I am better than you kind" like photographic memory<br> (which is fake, no one ever had it; people just said they did to look smart).<p>World's politicians are facing these flaws as well,<br> they can't tell if Homeopathy is real or not, not without a real education.<p>Today, there is nothing that can be done about people in authority lacking in education,<br> the only thing that can stop them is time.<p>And it is our job now,<br> that the new generation of Policy Makes does not suffer from inability to tell real from fantasy.<p>In the absence of teachers,<br> we become the teachers.<p>I challenge you my Dear Readers,<br> to books, to becoming a teacher, and a Great Being, helping the world grow in health.<p><br><br><p>We have to help children understand that a life of fantasy,<br> is not a complete life, that it is our right to live in realty.<p>Our generation, must be the generation of the Well Read, of The Wise, of The Teachers,<br> with a clear vision of the future; we are not to fight, we are to learn and teach.<p>The children will grow up into a world where corruption of today,<br> has passed of old age, of its own toxic sickness.<p>The children must learn to be teachers as well,<br> bu they face even a greater task, the task of becoming Incorruptible Leaders.<p>The leaders the world hopes to see today,<br> those are the children that look up to us for guidance.<p><br><br><p>We must rise today.<br> Rise against lies and liars, manipulators and cheaters, leeches and big fat white lice,<br> we must rise against poverty, against fake education and the grades that connive children they are not enough.<p>We must rise, against every ongoing mistake,<br> every invisible wall,<br> and stand our ground.<p>Knowing that our world is the world of reality,<br> and that is the only world worthy of us.<p>With all our might, we are not to fight,<br> we are to live our lives and finally reach happiness,<br> but on our way there we are to learn, become wise, become teachers, and aim to become great beings.<p>Not only for our own dignity and to honor those we love,<br> but also for all the future yet to come.<p>May all the future generation read our works,<br> and determine that this year, was the first year of the new era they they hold so dearly.<p>That this year, was the year that future thinkers marked,<br> as The Day Humanity Entered Into The Age Of Wisdom.<p></div> <hr class="border-info my-5"></div></div> <div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-xxl-6 offset-md-1 offset-xxl-3"><nav aria-label="Post Navigation"><ul class="pagination pagination-lg"><li class=page-item><a href=/category/poetry/read/poetry-0170 class="bg-dark border-0 focus-0 page-link" title="The Sword Can't Even Compare To Your Pen">« Older</a></li> <li class=page-item><a href=/category/poetry/read/poetry-0172 class="bg-dark border-0 focus-0 page-link" title="The Sword Can't Even Compare To Your Pen">Newer »</a></ul></nav></div></div> <div class="row mb-5"><div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-xxl-6 offset-md-1 offset-xxl-3"><div class="mb-3 card shadow"><div class=card-header><div class="small text-truncate"> Navigating 172 Posts in Poetry Category</div></div> <div class=card-body><a href=/radio class="btn btn-sm mt-1 btn-secondary"><img src=/icons/volume-up.svg style=filter:invert(1) alt="" height=16 width=16> Radio Meow 2.0</a> <a href=/ class="btn btn-sm mt-1 btn-outline-info"><img src=/icons/view-stacked.svg style=filter:invert(1) alt="" height=16 width=16> All Posts</a> <a href=/category class="btn btn-sm mt-1 btn-outline-info"><img src=/icons/card-list.svg style=filter:invert(1) alt="" height=16 width=16> Browse Categories</a> <a href=/tag class="btn btn-sm mt-1 btn-outline-info"><img src=/icons/tag.svg style=filter:invert(1) alt="" height=16 width=16> Browse Tags</a> <a href=/read/poetry-0171 class="btn btn-sm mt-1 btn-outline-warning"><img src=/icons/x-octagon.svg style=filter:invert(1) alt="" height=16 width=16> Uncategorize</a></div></div></div></div></div></section></main> <footer class="mb-3 mt-5 text-muted"><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-xxl-6 offset-md-1 offset-xxl-3"><a href=#top class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-info float-right mr-2">back to top</a> <a href=http://catpea.com/ class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-info float-left ml-2">catpea.com</a> <a href=http://news.catpea.com/ class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-info float-left ml-2">news.catpea.com</a></div></div> <div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-xxl-6 offset-md-1 offset-xxl-3 p-3 small text-center"><a href=http://news.catpea.com>Cat Pea News Network</a> is part of the <a href=http://catpea.com>Cat Pea Fun Factory</a></div></div></div></footer> </div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"",preloaded:[void 0,null,null,null,{category:"poetry",post:"poetry-0171"}]};if('serviceWorker' in navigator)navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');(function(){try{eval("async function x(){}");var main="/client/client.eb4f7f72.js"}catch(e){main="/client/legacy/client.9862fd8d.js"};var s=document.createElement("script");try{new Function("if(0)import('')")();s.src=main;s.type="module";s.crossOrigin="use-credentials";}catch(e){s.src="/client/shimport@1.0.1.js";s.setAttribute("data-main",main);}document.head.appendChild(s);}());</script>
