You don't need a charging bear to learn.<br> You can use clay, or canvas, or music.<p>There is no finer way to push loneliness away,<br> than to sculpt the meaning of touch.<p>And there is no better way to learn courage,<br> than to paint a chain of works that inspire to motion.<p>And music need not make someone cry to be powerful,<br> make the beat move your own feet, as you run your first ultra.<p><br><br><p>Consider how simple a Desktop in your Operating System is,<br> and yet, how perfectly impossible it is, to drag the icon out of the computer.<p>It is right there, you can wiggle it,<br> and yet it is trapped in a prison, of invisible walls.<p><br><br><p>And consider, how different you are, from all the people you have met,<br> how you don't even smile at the things that make them laugh.<p>How not a single person of out the Eight Billion,<br> could possibly take your place.<p>How often it feels that all the people around you are sleepy,<br> how some seem different, because they could not do, what they do, if they were not wide awake.<p>To integrate with wisdom, you cannot read the same books others read,<br> your mind represents a perfectly unique constellation of stars.<p>To integrate with wisdom,<br> not only do you have to indirectly wiggle around by subtle analogy to other things.<p>But you have to fish out just the perfect morsels that fit you,<br> in just the perfect sequence, out of a unique collection of mutually reinforcing works of Philosophy.<p><br><br><p>You start in the beginning, with Survey Courses, as these outline the most brilliant ideas first,<br> there you can recognize thoughts that fit you, that you already had in your constellation.<p>Organized Education, poisons your confidence in education, because everything they teach,<br> is in an inhuman, synthetic, and impersonal sequence.<p>Moreover, the easily forgotten and fragile clusters of incomplete information,<br> aim to build on one another, they guarantee you won't understand, and will only overwhelm you in the end.<p>The celebrating of a Diploma, is a sacred ritual, that has been erased, and replaced,<br> with a more sugarcoated "I am finally out".<p>This is a perfect recipe for bondage, blindness, weakness,<br> and worse.<p>We must not allow a fake sugar pop triumph,<br> to replace the Real Triumph or Knowledge and Wisdom.<p>It can only get worse,<br> a day will come when the Libraries will close.<p>School and Library, above all, were meant to be a symbol,<br> an extension to your own self education.<p>Your Education,<br> the pathway to Peace, Safety, Security, Self Control, Harmony, Enlightenment.<p><br><br><p>What has occurred to cause the fog, is a drop of packets of information,<br> we are too complex, the world is too complex, parenting is too complex, teaching is too complex.<p>It can get worse, if we continue celebrating false graduations, and fake education,<br> if we keep forgetting that our family, has Eight Billion members and each must grow up for real.<p>The solution is to remind ourselves, that growing up is not about feeling like an adult,<br> but rather Transcending our Limits, and Pushing Through gaps, towards Wisdom.<p>We face problems that can only be solved by Intellectual or Cultural Unity.<p>The Problem of War, is solved by Education, Wisdom, and Unity.<p>The Problem of Education, is solved by Helping Everyone to a Fair Start.<p>The Problem of Crime, can be Solved by Mental Heath Care, and Prevention.<p>The Problem of Poverty and Slavery, is Solved by Universal Income.<p>All these problems are our problems, and the solutions are ours as well.<p>But they rest across a Gap, a gap that Humanity must cross.<p>And the next step,<br> is your step.<p><br><br><p>Nothing worth your precious time, can be faked, or made up, or make believe,<br> it all has to be Authentic, Powerful, Guttural, Raw.<p>It will hurt in the Muscle and Bone,<br> but eventually you'll forget to pay attention to what is unimportant.<p>You are not to be taught that you are dime a dozen,<br> and that they just can't find a job for you, because you don't fit or conform.<p>People believe this nonsense,<br> because they don't have anything to draw from by subtle analogy.<p>That is why we must challenge ourselves to Great Deeds,<br> to acquire the experiences necessary to tell Wisdom from Waste.<p>When you hear someone putting you down, pushing you around, belittling you,<br> you are to leave, because that someone has fractured and broke, and are now ill.<p>It is the oldest and sickest trick,<br> to convince someone they don't matter.<p>They do it for personal gain, money or laziness,<br> to people who do not have a library of Grand Experiences from which they can draw wisdom, by Subtle Analogy.<p><br><br><p>Get Up.<p>Find your temple of solitude, The Two Beautiful Trees, The Bridge Over Hudson River,<br> The Highway Overpass, The Starry Beach where the Stars Come Out at Night and mingle with Starfish.<p>And know, that you are a Child of The Universe, first,<br> That! is your background.<p>Now face Humanity anew,<br> out from the edge of the Universe.<p>Look,<br> look at all those things that made you small.<p>Look how unimportant the inauthentic is,<br> how fragile those words that upset you really were.<p><br><br><p>And pay attention, to the real problem,<br> how easily you were tricked and mislead.<p>That cannot go on,<br> you are not a push around.<p>I wish you knew how Powerful you really are,<br> how easily you learn at your own pace in the sequence that fits you best.<p>How All Too Human, all too familiar, all too easy,<br> the acquisition of wisdom really is.<p><br><br><p>Not all Adults are defined by Outspoken Wisdom, some find Greatness in Love Returned,<br> and what a Great Power, can those Two even make a mistake?<p>I don't think there is anything other than Love, that can substitute for Wisdom,<br> it is both The Love of Two, and The Love of a Big Mother in a large family,<br> a Mother that always brings hugs, warm meals and Wisdom.<p>But, True Love is rare, so while you search, you must also grow in Wisdom,<br> from now on, you will have to learn to tell the children apart from the adults.<p>And not by looking at how old they are, or how well they dress, or how sharply they move in their environment,<br> you will now look at their Authenticity, and Content of Character.<p>No one who lacks in Authenticity, or has little Content of Character,<br> has anything to contribute to you life, certainly nothing negative.<p>Hope for them to recover, and become wise, and healthy,<br> let them know that they are a Child of The Universe, and they count - but go.<p>Don't let anybody hurt you,<br> don't let anybody hurt your heart, or mind.<p><br><br><p>Go!<br> because you need your heart and mind, to grow.<p>Go!,<br> with the certainty of knowing that you are more.<p>Go!,<br> so as long as you Rise you won't be lonely for long.<p>Go!<br> because there has never been a way other than forward and up.<p>Go!<br> and don't be scared, all great journeys start with little things.<p><br><br><p>The Others, who went through the same,<br> are with you in Spirit.<p>So many invisible battles have been fought,<br> and as much triumph gone unnoticed.<p>The Warriors are everywhere, and they stand by your side,<br> you are in company of Great Heroes.<p>Climb by subtle analogy to the triumphs already had,<br> rise to the highest of mountains.<p>You are Meant to Become a Great Being,<br> and You are meant to remind others to follow a similar path.<p>Rise, and you will be well on your way,<br> Humanity only grows, when people like you tear down those thin invisible walls.<p><br><br><p>Wherever you are right now, begin transcending your limits,<br> no matter how small, each will help you learn more.<p>With each new success more pathways will become visible to you,<br> you are not trapped, you are just at the beginning of your journey.<p>It is hard to see it all because you are still learning,<br> but it is easy to read or listen to books, and inherit great visions from others.<p>It will never get easier,<br> but you will grow greater, to a point where ease will become irrelevant to your existence.<p>You must use your Heart and Mind to learn all the lessons ahead,<br> no one can teach you, you must find your own books.<p>By Subtle Analogy,<br> Rise to Your Greatness.<p></div> <hr class="border-info my-5"></div></div> <div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-xxl-6 offset-md-1
