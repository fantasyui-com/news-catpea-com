what it looks like,<br> because Human Beings, are not of the world of sequentially predictable machines.<p>Human Beings emerged, out of infinitely increasing complexity,<br> by rules of infinite accidents along lines of fuzzy principles.<p>In a word, we are here because the Universe mixed it self for so long<br> that the failure for life to occur became inconceivable.<p>And, we want to believe life emerged, on Earth,<br> just like we wanted to believe that earth was the center of the Universe.<p>And we want to believe that Earth was the first to have life,<br> my goodness, how much more special could we be, the first in the Universe.<p>Universe is a large place, that has been around for a long time,<br> it is better not to think of anything cosmic, as that! special.<p>But there is one exception.<p>Once you come down to Earth, come up to Life, and look then Into The Conscious Self Aware Mind,<br> that is no longer a common occurrence.<p>There is nothing normal about it,<br> we are now at the limits of what the Universe could possibly conceive of.<p>No machine or hybrid can measure up to the raw power of unleashed consciousness.<p>Nothing partially conscious, can know the depth of Sadness,<br> nothing less than conscious could know the Miracle of Happiness.<p><br><br><p>We are used to thinking of ourselves as work horses,<br> great locomotives that can plow through Pandemics, or a Broken Heart.<p>But that is a temporary oversimplification just to keep visions clear,<br> born of a finely tuned mind that can narrow all views down to the important bits.<p>Focus and selective attention is not a limitation of our mind,<br> it is a feature that clears away unimportant things.<p>When we need recall, we can have it in full,<br> just imagine your favorite place, and trace along the walls.<p>Every window, picture, appliance, and outlet, all the important knickknacks are all there,<br> we don't have memory problems, we don't need better brains.<p>The convergence that we need is not about integrating with technology,<br> but combining the good parts of our cultures, so that the world can learn towards Peace.<p>Without that shared wisdom, people are easily tricked to believe in conflict,<br> into the belief that there are borders, and across borders they must fight.<p>By not helping each other to understand how special and unique we each are,<br> there grows a vocal minority of machine like minds, that think in mechanical terms.<p>They add to get more, they take to be more,<br> they divide to make enemy, and subtract enemy to spread more.<p>They think they are a cog, in a bigger machine,<br> but there is no machine, just that blind mind.<p><br><br><p>It is OK to focus on just a few things so that we may grow, and grow in wisdom too,<br> but it is not OK to live in some narrow channel for simplicity sake.<p>It actually isn't OK to do things to simplify,<br> complexity only moves in one direction.<p>There is nothing healthy that can be done to un-mix a cup of tea,<br> there is nothing useful to be found in moving backwards in time.<p>Complexity grows, and to make sense of growing complexity,<br> we cannot hope to simplify it, but rather adapt our minds to grasp it more efficiently.<p>The World must Go Forward, Move Forward,<br> what needs to change is out Tolerance for Bad Ideas.<p>But growing up to the challenges of ever increasing complexity requires wisdom,<br> and wisdom cannot be manufactured, it must be grown.<p>Wisdom is a product of Love,<br> not the Beating Heart, but the Human Capacity to Love the Universe, The World, and The Human Family.<p><br><br><p>My Dear Readers,<br> Becoming a Great Being, becoming Wise and Enlightened,<br> is the actual definition of being an Adult.<p>Pretending to be an Adult, by acting mature,<br> is to make a fool of yourself, probably while throwing away what makes you Beautiful.<p>Throwing away your Sweetens, and Foolishness, and Innocence, and all the Smiles that happen for no reason.<br> That's not growing up, that's the worst thing you can do to your self, and is probably very unhealthy.<p>To become an Adult,<br> is to become a Philosopher.<p>Philosophy is about Loving Wisdom,<br> is your Wisdom not the most precious thing within you?<p>Universe, the biggest thing there is, in all it's might and complexity,<br> a thing so powerful, that it may in some part, travel around it self in time.<p>It can't do wisdom, best it can do is Evolution,<br> but it can't do wisdom, it cannot know, it doesn't know such a thing could exist.<p>And each and every one of us has the capacity for it,<br> a volitional faculty to bring up a folder of your Noblest Thoughts.<p>You are more powerful than the Universe,<br> the only thing that can keep you down,<br> is you never becoming aware of your Great Power.<p>I know Superman comes to mind when you think of Superpowers and Superheroes,<br> But do think Superman is actually super because he can lift or fly?<p>If Superman was as super as he needs to be, he would become Human,<br> and build Schools to prevent War a Hundred Years before it happened.<p>He'd then age, so that the Little Ones,<br> would listen to him without dismissing him as a Genius that lives on cloud nine.<p>He'd then let the little ones build with a thousand minds,<br> what his one mind, couldn't grasp.<p>The greatest of superheroes, would encourage us to build things,<br> that help the world to converge,<br> on Cultures of Wisdom that leave bad ideas behind.<p>I ask you, My Dear Readers,<br> to begin moving towards becoming Great Wise Beings,<br> towards growing up by means of searching for wisdom,<br> growing all the way up so that you stand as Authentic Adults.<p>And rising to the challenge of inspiring a thousand minds,<br> to accomplish what your one mind, can only barely conceive of today.<p></div> <hr class="border-info my-5"></div></div> <div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-xxl-6 offset-md-1
