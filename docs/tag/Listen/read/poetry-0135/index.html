class=ml-3><p><p>I dreamt I was tumbling through time,<br> and I had no control over which fragments I see.<p>There was a mother writing a letter to a famous movie star,<br> she was asking him to stop making movies, because her boy didn't comeback from war.<p>And it worked,<br> and she wrote many letters.<p>There was a lot of shocked artists and actors,<br> they had no idea how they shaped young impressionable minds.<p>Boys wanted to go to real war,<br> to be like the imaginary heroes they saw on TV.<p><br><br><p>And then I struggled in my dream, because my bullies were clearly ill, they were not all there,<br> but World's Systems of Justice do not differentiate between the ill and the healthy.<p>And so a person made permanently ill in their mind by poverty,<br> is seen equal to a man of knowledge, insight, intelligence.<p>But the ill have little freedom of choice,<br> they need therapy, and safety, and good homes, and hope, and dreams.<p>To punish someone who couldn't grow up, didn't know to learn,<br> for something that they weren't sure they were doing,<br> and then to send them to a hopeless place without a hope of healing,<br> without any hope of rehabilitation... is wrong.<p>If they can't walk among us, if they are permanently ill,<br> then build special schools for them, schools that bring hope.<p>We mustn't punish them more than life already had,<br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2tOp7OxyQ8">our humanity depends on everyone’s humanity</a>.<p><br><br><p>And I saw Mr. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6IKu2wgm5I">Pirsig</a> on his motorcycle with his boy,<br> the wind in his face representing the cutting edge of reality.<p>He was worried that his Metaphysics is not real philosophy,<br> it was not going to be taken seriously.<p>The answers they discovered on road they traveled and experiences they shared,<br> created the Body of Knowledge that provided them with the forward momentum they needed to move ahead.<p>I dreamt that Pirsig was just talking bout Authenticity, Nobility and Dignity,<br> and Knowledge and Wisdom, and Wise Intuition.<p>He is unafraid to show us how vulnerable Philosophers are,<br> that all it takes is ideas worth sharing, once or twice.<p>Anybody can be a philosopher,<br> we will each be heard.<p><br><br><p>All these strange fragments added together - to remind us that the World is Not Static,<br> that it grows, moves, changes, and cares not to stop for things writ on paper.<p>Advancements in Psychology... the trailer to the movie about Philip Zimbardo work - alone,<br> should invalidate laws and behaviors previously thought acceptable.<p>Humanity must grow, our cultures must drive us all forward,<br> we must never assume that the world we are born into is a masterpiece.<p>And we must never let ourselves think,<br> that others are in charge - it is our world, it belongs to us all.<p><br><br><p>To make informed decisions,<br> we require knowledge, wisdom, foresight, insight, a sense of belonging.<p>Without knowledge, we will not be able to see right from wrong,<br> nor will any of our decisions do our elder selves justice.<p>Access to well grounded knowledge is not difficult,<br> internet lectures - alone - may even suffice, but best selling non fiction audio books solve it completely.<br><p><br><br><p>Humanity must not fall behind on growing up,<br> the longer the delay the greater the injustice.<p>Read and Listen to you books, my Friends,<br> inherit the lifetimes of knowledge within.<p>We can't send people to prison without any hope of rehabilitation,<br> for uninformed decisions that came on a whim.<p>And we can't allow mere Practice of Law without Functional Rehabilitation,<br> and above all Meaningful Education and Universal Basic Income that truly lifts people out of Poverty.<p><br><br><p>We Are The People, we outgrew borders long ago, we are One Family on a Lonely Blue Earth.<br><p>We must learn to catch up with what is worthy of knowing,<br> we can use Science, or Love, or both, or the Leading Edge of Instinct powered by our Humanity.<p>But we must continue building this world,<br> each generation must make improvements and never stop.<p>Those who stand in power today,<br> are to soon gracefully surrender to the better wisdom of the new generation.<p>To preside is to wisely wait whilst the new generation becomes worthy of the position,<br> and to quietly step down, and put whatever wisdom was discovered to the books of history.<p>To preside, means not, to continue repeating mistakes because they are on the books,<br> and therefore one will not be punished.<p>There are only two sides to history, and only fools think it is the winning and the losing one,<br> the two sides as seen by future generations is the Wrong One, and The Noble One.<p>Let us all rise to the challenges of wisdom,<br> and making lasting and meaningful contributions to the Human Family.<p>Let us not be lost to the wrong side,<br> let us not be passed over by the books of history,<br> let us help wisdom propagate.<p>Let us stand up to every corner and every challenge,<br> and let us speak out against the wrong, the mistakes, the incomplete, the unfinished.<p>Let us not accept half measures, or good enough, or status quo,<br> or the lowest common denominator minimums that get commited to law books.<p>Let us remember who we are,<br> and how Noble The Human Being.<p>Let us stand upright,<br> in Authenticity, Dignity, Wisdom and Compassion.<p></div> <hr class="border-info my-5"></div></div> <div
