class=ml-3><p><p>Well, from the first moment on,<br> we are asked if we should live in harmony.<p>We are still very young,<br> barely know of the world.<p>And already the question of harmony comes,<br> and in harmony we learn, and thrive.<p>Away from it, we'll be interrupted,<br> and feel lost in the void.<p>It is a simple choice,<br> but out minds are not ready to make it.<p>Often we forget.<p>We forget about our little gardens,<br> and all the little walks.<p>We forget how amazing it felt,<br> to stand on the wing of a plane.<p>We forget the taste of popcorn at the Zoo,<br> or even how enormous Zoo felt.<p>We forget pebbles at the river,<br> and mischievous squires at the park.<p><br><br><p>That little dog with a bark,<br> that scaredy kitten always hiding in the dark.<p>Our collection of unused keys,<br> and the box of bottle caps we collected with ease.<p>We forgot our Lego and the old bike,<br> with that seat that we used to really like.<p>We don't remember the Palaces and Castles,<br> that we used to love, and those swords, that fit us like a glove.<p><br><br><p>Everybody else came around,<br> acting like they know the ground.<p>But, this was our gift from the Universe,<br> an affinity for flowering gardens, and little passage ways, and all those flying planes.<p>It was a key to unlock our mind,<br> to understand the zoo, and our size in the universe, connect with pebbles at the beach.<p>It is a pathway that fits us best,<br> to love little creatures, and collect some shineys, and build with blocks, and ride far and wide.<p>It was to remind us,<br> to find our place among Great Beings, and study and pursue excellence, in all we do.<p><br><br><p>Then they sent us to First Grade,<br> and the weird kid peed into the Duplo, they didn't even have Lego.<p>Then the teacher graded you down for counting pebles in your pocket,<br> and did it so many times, you lost track.<p><br><br><p>There was a whisper about the pebbles,<br> it was Mr. Sagan - "You are made of Star Stuff."<p>And then the kids whispered...<br> to push you in the mud.<p><br><br><p>Push their laughter aside,<br> you'll need to Learn, and learn really hard.<p>Cause right now, you're in the mud,<br> and you need to hang on.<p>It will get worse,<br> but all you have to do is rise.<p>Each time,<br> you'll rise higher.<p>(When in trouble, call the Police it is OK for kids to call the Police, they'll love helping you, don't be scared.)<p><br><br><p>Third Grade,<br> Fifth Grade.<p>Low grade,<br> Uhh, but there can't be higher.<p>Because by this time, you're getting bad grades,<br> because the teacher thinks you're copying from somewhere.<p>The bullies know,<br> you did it on your own.<p>Saw you pacing for days,<br> with your first program.<p>Keep going forward,<br> don't let go - you're doing great, stay away from the hate.<p><br><br><p>By the time you're out of Eight Grade,<br> by rejecting crazy, and nonsense, and stupid, and lazy, you graduate above all others.<p>Because you didn't follow,<br> because you chose to study on your own, at your own pace.<p>Because worthless grades meant nothing,<br> you felt no stress.<p>Because, you didn't follow<br> nothing could hurt you.<p>And your world is yours,<br> truly-truly yours.<p><br><br><p>We unravel, when we forget who we are,<br> the moment we hide, or pretend, or follow.<p>And, gosh darn it,<br> it happens when we are still kids.<p>We are completely unprepared,<br> and none will help.<p><br><br><p>So you! have to keep it together,<br> you can't let anyone hurt your mind.<p>In High School, the pretenders make a sudden appearance,<br> never held a book in their hand.<p>The back of Hamlet,<br> all the quotes have more IQ.<p>Let the little Caesars,<br> keep the wind from the hall away.<p>You need to pace your reading at the library,<br> teach yourself focus.<p>Don't EVER! finish the books,<br> just get to the part that is valuable to you, and skip the rest.<p><br><br><p>Start working on your start-up early,<br> it is a study in failure.<p>You need to create a series of CONTROLLED FAILURES,<br> this is very important.<p>Learn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=content+management">content management</a>,<br> and figure out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=stripe+wordpress">billing</a><p>That's your surface platform,<br> and think about nature of business.<p>Never try to build things directly,<br> facilitate the building of direct things for others.<p>Help them setup,<br> so that you are not burdened, and keep going.<p>Look at the structure of start-up accelerators, or even banks,<br> they take a percent, and never create what will weigh them down.<p>Eventually, you can build your own Tesla,<br> but at first, you start with services.<p>Look at the gym,<br> monthly subscription, is most stable.<p>The lessons, are all around you.<p><br><br><p>You don't need college,<br> but taking college classes is very relaxing.<p>Make sure you get a 4.0 at each class,<br> be ready to repeat it.<p>And enjoy,<br> the lectures.<p>College is just a toy,<br> it looks bad on your Portfolio, so hide it.<p>It is a very weak teaching experience,<br> and people know that there there is minimal learning involved.<p>Jumping from high school to start-ups is more impressive,<br> and shows that you chose knowledge over nonsense.<p>It shows that you chose to learn on your own,<br> to take care of your own mind,<br> rather than to pretend to learn for grades.<p>Authenticity is very important in life,<br> it is hard to connect with people that role play.<p><br><br><p>Bonding with people that are just acting,<br> is only functional for as long as they are acting.<p>But it is never good,<br> eventually they'll have a crisis, similar to a mid-life crisis.<p>Stay Authentic,<br> keep to to those who are Authentic.<p>Be safe.<p><br><br><p>When it feels like everyone else is having an amazing life,<br> and you are stuck.<p>Umm... that not true<p>But it is also not healthy to think this way about yourself,<br> you are not beneath the party goers, they don't have what you have in your mind.<p><br><br><p>But, that's far enough,<br> time to get some rest.<p><br><br><p>This is where it gets interesting,<br> you have primed your mind for Business.<p>That is a fine first step,<br> now you need to get ready for the real graduation.<p>You need to section hike the equivalent of the Appalachian Trail,<br> and measure your jogging a hundred miles at a time.<p>Section jogging, the Western States 100.<p>Mind and Body, for the rest of your life.<p>You must take good care of both.<p><br><br><p>At mile fifty, halfway through a run,<br> as you piece together your blurry thoughts of your next business.<p>Take some time to understand what it is that College Grads have,<br> those are very brittle relationships, and inflexible careers.<p>We all feel the promise, but we can't fake it,<br> it would be the opposite, and certainly not worthy of you, my Friends.<p>You can only find your meaning in Authenticity,<br> shortcuts will only take you back to the beginning.<p>To live among the Extraordinary,<br> you must become Extraordinary yourself.<p><br><br><p>The gateway to Meaning of Life,<br> is in that tiny moment when you think to your self:<p>"I am not going to jog tonight, I need rest."<p>Right there in that dot,<br> is the keyhole,<br> to the key that you are,<br> to the gateway that you need to open.<p>Life is not a simulation,<br> there are no days off,<br> life is quite a challenge,<br> and demands that each moment builds on the authenticity of the previous.<p><br><br><p>Open the dot, how can you yearn for Authenticity and Companionship,<br> and cancel, and fall short, and not enough, and rest some more.<p>The gateway between Ordinary and Extraordinary,<br> is in accepting that we haven't got a choice to make.<p>But shoes... to put on,<br> your Mind and Body must grow in harmony.<p>You must not let go of the Harmony,<br> of your Magnificent Existence.<p>Each small success, by subtle analogy,<br> pushes you forward, to your next step.<p><br><br><p>Eventually your tightly controlled business failures,<br> will fail, they will, fail to fail.<p>Your mind too,<br> it won't perceive the easy choice as an option.<p>All- will proceed,<br> in harmony.<p><br><br><p>Labored breathing,<br> by the Pine Trees at Western States,<p>Another great step in Automation of your business,<br> and more investors.<p>And you're no longer stopping at the first thing you find in books,<br> you understand all of it.<p>What is made by humans,<br> is also All Too Human.<p><br><br><p>And the Bullies are Gone,<br> and Eight Grade still sucks.<p>High school ... influences,<br> are trying to figure out where they went wrong - good luck!<p>College, is still a very romantic idea,<br> but it is best left to imagination.<p>Your dreams are so much more now,<br> only what you create can live up to them.<p>You are a Leader,<br> full of might an joy.<p><br><br><p>And now you know,<br> shortcuts only lead people to their beginnings.<p>And the one road, the only road,<br> was the one of Authenticity, and Achievement.<p>Where we learned for real, not for grades,<br> where what we learned added up to create wisdom, and not a stupid GPA.<p>You'll be OK, so as long as you Learn onward and become Wise,<br> and Live in Authentic Harmony with Yourself.<p>This is how you become an Adult,<br> that was the one thing that all others were missing.<p>It's what made them pretend and simulate,<br> but, growing up can't be faked.<p>Growing up has to be written by the choices you make,<br> on the surface, that is your lifetime.<p>The dreams you always dream, will come true,<br> but not in your childhood, childhood is for learning.<p>Live in Harmony with yourself,<br> and live in harmony with the Universe.<p>Growing up is really special,<br> it is really important for our health.<p>It is a deeply internal process,<br> and there are no shortcuts to growing up.<p>It is meant to be,<br> Beautiful.<p></div> <hr class="border-info my-5"></div></div> <div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-xxl-6 offset-md-1
