class=ml-3><p><p>My Friends,<p>Your youth holds a great power,<br> a power that you can hold on to throughout your entire existence.<p>It is the power of creating a life that you will love,<br> a life that will help you see with great clarity.<p>A Life of Wisdom.<p><br><br><p>But you must be careful, as the world may not yet be ready to help you.<p>Not everyone will know about growing up,<br> and people will say: "How was I supposed to know?"<p>And they are not going to be the bad guys,<br> and you will be inclined to listen to their advice.<p>And the path will be paved with good intentions,<br> it maybe the correct path, but it won't be the right one.<p><br><br><p>Please, focus on building your own self,<br> your strength, your wisdom, your power.<p>Focus on building the best you,<br> the you that you are meant to be, that the world needs.<p><br><br><p>Because if you listen to everybody else,<br> you will not grow up, and they will blame you for not being able to help them.<p>You are not going to be able to explain to them,<br> that you are weak because of them,<br> because you tried to help them too early.<p>And if you could, all they could say will be:<br> "How was I supposed to know?"<p><br><br><p>Please, you have no choice,<br> but to learn to control your own future.<p>You can try to use your imagination,<br> to get in touch with your Elder Self;<p>And ask "What are your regrets?",<br> "Where did it go wrong?"<p><br><br><p>Please, carefully evaluate your choices,<br> wisely build your Mind and Body.<p>Pay attention to all the choices you are making,<br> as they dictate the Beautiful Life Ahead of You.<p><br><br><p>The teachers are not ready, we are not in the Era of Wisdom yet,<br> people are struggling to understand life.<p>Many make choices that all too early box them in,<br> and not all their advice will apply to you.<p>Not all the things that you think box people in,<br> actually constrain them, there are many contexts to all the paths.<p>All lives are beautiful, and there are enough forks in the road,<br> for people to navigate back to where they want to be.<p>But, when a mistake occurs, it will weigh you down for a time,<br> if you are careful, you can avoid the worst of it.<p>And whatever does happen, regardless of how hard you tried to avoid it,<br> will not crush you, because you will know you did your best.<p><br><br><p>Please, be careful in life, be beautiful, and strong,<br> learn, and think, and evaluate, and judge, and grow in wisdom.<p>Following everyone's advice, will create a lot of noise,<br> listening to everything from everywhere will never align with you.<p>You must lean to pace yourself,<br> and to carefully and wisely follow what interests you.<p>Your mind is constantly asking questions,<br> your future depends on having a good intuition, rooted in reality, and in wisdom.<p>There is nothing you can be force-taught school,<br> you will not retain things that are out of sequence.<p>Reaching out for Knowledge and Wisdom in your own sequence, and at your own pace,<br> is the only way to learn, and build steps, and build on top of those steps.<p>No one can decide what lesson you are ready for next,<br> that is something that comes from the complexity of your own mind.<p>Those people who are doing well in school without cramming and memorization,<br> have previously arrived at those subjects in their own sequence.<p><br><br><p>The same applies to your job, your career,<br> your career needs to emerge from the path you were growing up with.<p>It needs to be an an extension of your pursuits,<br> it must benefit you, and help you grow.<p>Just like you must actually learn, instead of just getting grades,<br> your work must add to you, and not, rob you of your years.<p>Do you understand the value of a Single Year of Your Precious Life?<br> no one can put a price on that, not even you, there are not enough atoms in the Universe.<p>That is why Harmony with Education, and Work is so important,<br> each year must be lived on the path that makes you grow.<p><br><br><p>I am so sorry, that people will tell you to cram for tests,<br> and get a job, and get on with life.<p>I am so sorry, My Friends,<br> but that is the worst, you can do.<p>That's why you can't listen to anyone,<br> that's why you have to look into yourself.<p>Carefully evaluate all decisions,<br> whilst carefully evaluating consequences, and being mindful of your future.<p>You are not alone, look to Memoirs, look to Biographies,<br> listen to Audiobooks, Explore, and Create.<p><br><br><p>And you must take care of your body,<br> the best you can, at first.<p>And with each year,<br> you will gain more, and add a bit more as you grow in Health and Fortitude.<p>Your Elder Self needs to be Flexible, and Healthy,<br> you may never grunt and complain, that's something you have to be mindful of now.<p>It is not just about making choices for your Future,<br> but also for your body too.<p><br><br><p>Do you see how going along with cramming for tests,<br> can put you in a field where your job makes life more stressful,<br> which will prevent you from taking good care of your body?<p>Imagine the consequences of walking a path that is not truly your own,<br> and what will your Elder Self feel when you two finally become, One?<p>Be gentle with yourself,<br> this is Your Life, Your Beautiful-Beautiful Life.<p><br><br><p>Put down the incomprehensible Text Book, the standardized tests,<br> and <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/130.Best_Audiobooks_Ever>find</a> an Audiobook that you will love and actually learn from.<p>Stop trying to find a job or get hired, and become the kind of a person;<br> that companies can only hope to hire.<p>Start living healthy, years before you start your training,<br> do not force your body into endurance, gradually teach it to adapt.<p><br><br><p>Chose Audio-books that really help your wisdom grow,<br> embrace your hobbies, and expand your adventures.<p>If you can't find a career path that will add onto you,<br> then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4JtyLKDjXk">start your own company</a>, or become a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRLzkbtKPGM">co-founder</a>.<p>Take care of your body, be mindful of you <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index>Body Mass Index</a>,<br> but also aim to become a Healthy Athlete, Heath will never take away from you.<p><br><br><p>In all we do, in choices, or intuitions,<br> we re driven by the wisdom we have thus far acquired.<p>A decision that made sense in your youth,<br> may reverse, as you gain wisdom from Books and Experiences.<p>The richer our Pursuit of Wisdom,<br> the more in-tune our decision-making.<p>Wisdom surrounds Education, Carrier and Health,<br> it influences your Private Decision-making, and thus Your Future.<p>In most contexts Wisdom is the most important thing,<br> what can be more important than the thing that influences your private decision making?<p>And be mindful that your decision making is in turn,<br> the very thing that influences all the future ahead of you?<p><br><br><p>The beginning of your Knowledge and Wisdom is found in the things you love as a child,<br> in a way those things are questions, and playing with them brings answers.<p>But you have to stay with it,<br> protect the natural progression of the chain of your curiosities.<p>You have to understand the the Destructive Power of:<br> "cram, get a job, and get on with your life".<p>We don't live in a world that can support your Pursuit of Wisdom,<br> for most, the world will give minimums, for many nothing.<p>When we try to create external machinery,<br> it will often perform the minimum.<p><br><br><p>The power for the world to change,<br> is within each of its Citizens.<p>It is found in decision making,<br> perpetually strengthened by Unrelenting Pursuit of wisdom.<p>We create this world together,<br> and it can only grow, when we grow.<p></div> <hr class="border-info my-5"></div></div> <div class=row><div
