class=ml-3><p><p>The only thing keeping us back, is lack of wisdom,<br> this is occurring because the world places no emphasis on becoming wise.<p>Without wisdom we can't even tell if education is real or not,<br> ...the mark of a real education are real results.<p>Without wisdom we can't tell what real results even are,<br> without wisdom we begin repeating old mistakes.<p>People say fake news - nope,<br> but it is actually the fake education...<p><br><br><p>Real education, helps a person become Wise and Noble,<br> Triumphant, Successful, Strong, Unbreakable.<p>In the real world no one ever celebrates graduation,<br> because Real Education is about a Dignified, Realistic Success.<p>If all students get is a Diploma and a Laboratory,<br> or even Debt and a job they didn't need a University for.<p><br><br><p>It is just a waste of time,<br> and time is priceless.<p><br><br><p>The central component of Real Education is Joy,<br> and satisfaction, and a sense of progression, and the undoing of the threat of poverty.<p>But without wisdom, it is hard to define poverty,<br> or satisfaction, or even what joy is supposed to mean in context of education.<p>Without wisdom, we are easily tricked that memorization has something to do with education,<br> we are easily tricked that confusion is just us not being good enough.<p><br><br><p>Memorization, is a cheap trick used by worthless teachers,<br> to pretend that they are doing something.<p>And by memorizing you make them appear legitimate,<br> you make them produce grades, and appear as teachers.<p>And that confusion is there because their lectures make no sense,<br> the text books probably don't make much sense either.<p><br><br><p>There is no conspiracy,<br> it is just people trying to fake it until they make it.<p>Many do have lessons they could teach you,<br> and just as many will keep them to themselves.<p>Just to appear smarter someday, or just out of spite,<br> "Why should I tell them, it is not in the text book".<p><br><br><p>Lack of wisdom will keep a teacher, childlike,<br> keep them thinking "this is just a job", "it is us versus them",<br> and that usual "I hate them", or "hate my job".<p>There are good teachers out there,<br> but for all their goodness,<br> they know deep down in their hearts.<p>That it is easier for you to learn on your own adventures,<br> Then for them to try to help you understand what they know.<p><br><br><p>Learning is very intimate, and teaching what one knows is taking that intimacy,<br> and trying to reshape it for strangers.<p>Almost by definition this takes away all the passion,<br> all the value of the lessons.<p><br><br><p>Good Teacher,<br> may just be an Oxymoron.<p>It is your life, it must be your own path of discovery and self betterment,<br> no one can help you through this.<p>Learning languages, is something we do naturally,<br> not by memorizing but by becoming submerged in the language; by actually needing it for survival.<p>If you want to learn French,<br> head for the Colonies, inhale the language, don't memorize it.<p>Learning mathematics, is similar, you don't do it by memorization,<br> in Real Mathematics same symbols mean different things based on context and author.<p>To learn Math, you start in the beginning,<br> and slowly trace its development across Empires and centuries.<p>Whatever it is You Have To Love It,<br> can you imagine loving every mathematician?<p>Because that's what it takes to learn Math for real,<br> or Physics, or Chemistry, or Biology, or Astrophysics.<p>Now imagine trying to teach a stranger,<br> what you have learned, but without the love that you have personally felt for it.<p>Oxymoron.<p><br><br><p>Being good at Biology, Dancing, Medicine, Trail Running, Math, Electronics, Art, Computers, Music,<br> still means little.<p>We get good at things we like,<br> it is not a big deal to be good at something.<p><br><br><p>Being Wise, is a Big Deal,<br> being able to Authentically and Nobly navigate live in a Dignified Fashion.<p>With wisdom, we can figure out how the world works,<br> the World is not a Mechanical Machine, now will it ever become a Political One,<br> it is a Conundrum of Human Conditions.<p>All else must yield,<br> it must.<p>It must,<br> until you are touching the fabric of the future with your very own fingertips.<p>Until,<br> you feel like a hero.<p>Until it is your voice, and your soul, and heart, and your works,<br> and your strength.<p>That make him, rise,<br> with certainty of knowing, you are correct.<p>Tired old man,<br> who has seen everything and heard every lie.<p>He's been a District Judge for more than he can remember,<br> but he has heard every world yo said.<p>And the moment you mentioned,<br> that it is Human Rights Day, he groaned.<p>And he stood downstairs,<br> keeping his hands warm with a cup of coffee.<p>And he stood there much longer than you could,<br> and it marked the end of his career.<p>But he never forgot your words,<br> because your words were filled with wisdom.<p>Because you searched for it,<br> because you fought for it.<p>Because you were courageous,<br> it all became crystal clear in your mind.<p>And more than moving a single judge,<br> you will grow to move a generation.<p>Grow to renew the search for meaning,<br> the Love of Wisdom.<p>You moved mountains,<br> you gave speeches long past your retirement.<p>As the cities of the future grew,<br> and as you grew.<p>And the life of wisdom made it so,<br> that your name and the symbols it stood for earned permanence in Human History.<p><br><br><p>Wisdom, is your right,<br> it is your first fight,<br> it is your greatest might.<br><p>Rise my friend,<br> rise to no end,<br> the world needs you to set the trend.<p></div> <hr
