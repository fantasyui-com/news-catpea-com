Added [Inner City, Good Life][1] preset to the Beat Sequencer to test support for multiple instruments. I also added Salamander Piano, which is based on [Yamaha C5 Grand Piano][2], a real Piano, it sounds nice ![](icons/megaphone.svg). Go to Shebang Slash Beat Sequencer, check some of those boxes to make the piano go. I set it as the default instrument.
