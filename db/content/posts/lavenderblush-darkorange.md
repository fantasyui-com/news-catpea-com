Creating [serserge][1] was in deed a good idea, the newest thing about it, is that it gives me the ability to query [Bootstrap][2] source-code for things like: "Hey! which things in the source-code have a background?"

Armed with this information I can mark components and their pieces for cloning (making my own copy) and then editing.

Now, the next step is DESIGN. The [image up top][3] (click to zoom) is a really good example of what design is... design makes you look.

Design is Pleasant.

Design, like a Remix of a Song, changes as not to bore.

I am going to make a new tool, here for catpea where I study certain approaches to creating artistic accents.

I have previously experimented with this by having created [skins][4], [neumorphism][5], [fantasy-gui][6], [synthwave][7] and [color-schemes][8]. For this first one I'll keep things even simpler.
