Captain's Log: Day Sixteen of Quarantine.

Keeping it serious like Wolverine.

I have decided not to rhyme,

I really haven't got the time.

I must leave the thieving Squirrels behind,

yes, really, I don't mind.

Today, is a new day, I am completely serious,

I am going to ignore everything hilarious.

I am not even joking, I'll ignore those furriers,

I won't even pay attention to their funny scurries.

I will sit here quiet,

tending to my amazing diet...

A stray thought bubbles to my idle mind,

Oh, no, I hope people won't go blind!

I think I am going to YouTube my workout dance,

Now, where the heck did I put my underpants?
