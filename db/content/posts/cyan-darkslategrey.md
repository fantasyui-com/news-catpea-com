THE FUTURE: Well, it takes about 50 lines of code to make music, to make MP3 files with mostly randomly generated fresh sounding music. There is no server requirement, everything happens in the browser crunching math in the user's CPU. Let us make future now, not tomorrow. I will now aim to create a Workout Song generator Widget/Gadget, that upon straining the CPU a bit will pop out files that can be played on the phone during workout. From Soundboard, to Beat Sequencer, to Song Maker. You might have noticed that the Beat Sequencer started sounding too complicated for a bit, "BPM", "Parts", "Beats", "Octave", "Note", "Scientific Notation", this is one lesson I want to take away from the Sequencer, the song generator will have to be massively abstract, it will have a setting for Softness rather than Samples and Presets, it will say Advanced Workout, Intermediate Workout, instead of BPM and Beats. I'll abstract away all the music-y stuff. Yah.
