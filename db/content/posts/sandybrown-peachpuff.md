Continued exploring potential for component re-usability. [Svelte's][1] [Sapper][2] is following WebComponents where templating is concerned (I can reference same slot multiple times), CSS module isolation works great, metaprogramming HTML with {#if}{:else}{/if} is fine. It does beat [Marko][3], [React][4] and [Vue][5].
