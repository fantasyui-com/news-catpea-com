On the Seventh Day of Quarantine I Added Tremolo ([LFO][1] effect) to the Sciurines in Memphis song (it is used in the second movement \[middle of the song\]), and made our imaginary band a sick medieval logo. All my generative music uses [Scientific Pitch Notation][2], take that Mozart. It looks like the CPU requirements are too high for mobile devices, small price to pay for a taste of Medieval [Sciurine][3] Pop. [Ship it!][4]
