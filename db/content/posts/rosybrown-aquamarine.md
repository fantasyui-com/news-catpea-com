Captain's Log, Eternal, Quarantine, Day Twenty Two.

Eeeeek! It's raining, I am trying not to be complaining.

But the sky is no longer blue, what am I to do?

Each time I sneeze, the power goes out,

not to say my sneezes are not petite, or that I am ill!

No, I am perfectly fine, I don't need to blow my nose.

It is the transformer outside that blows!

Frantically, atomically I hit CTRL+S, CTRL+S, save, save. Saves!

As the thunderous thunder thunders its electromagnetic waves.

How am I going to finish, how can I upload,

when any moment something will explode,

and there will be nothing where current once flowed.

While the rain has slowed, my fingers still tapping,

Save, save, save! rise! against the Gigawatt Wave.

Seriously, please remember to save your files,

this can only result in more smiles.

Also, please remember to backup your files.

As that's even better - by miles.
