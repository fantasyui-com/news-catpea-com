Working with the GUI, testing what I can alter, what I can't. I still have no idea what catpea is good for, what website format I should create. There is also a division of widgets forming some are useful tools (Song Beat Counter) others are little information displays (You Tube Videos, Season Countdown). As far as User Interface Design and getting things done goes, it is hard to beat chaos.
