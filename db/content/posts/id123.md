I made the UI a bit easier to follow, there is still a bunch of work to be done.

There maybe some broken links, but I think I got it all.

I continue learning how to use [Bootstrap][1] without twisting things around. I want to be able to create Themes that are Interchangable. That kind of programming is hard to get used to.

I've been somewhat quitet about my research becasue I was just programming the news site. Now the Tag/Category system will allow me to post Philosophy, Songs (that I may sing, eek) my music, bicycle adventures, and all kinds of things.
