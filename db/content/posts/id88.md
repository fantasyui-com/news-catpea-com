I created a new tool I named [Palette][1] this time it deals with color theory.

Right now it is focused on the five primary colors that most designers use.

In context of this tool they are labeled: Primary, Secondary, Success, Info, Warning, Danger.

[Bootstrap][2] developers call them contextual colors.

[Color Theory][3] is a tiny-tiny little bit more complicated than adjusting colors and themes.

But it is not very complicated. Most often it is just a cylinder of hues with colors going around.
