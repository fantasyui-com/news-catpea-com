Shebang Slash Soundboard is complete. Keeping things simple, is how good software gets done good. Now I need to add more presets, that should be fun. The preset data format looks like binary code, here is the Closed Hat for Billie Jean Meow Mix: {label:'Closed Hat', device:'lofi', octave:6, note:'C', data:expandNotation('1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010')} I came up with this, there is a bunch of repetitive stuff in data files, so I cooked up this 0/1 thing and a function that expands it into the data that the program ends up using.
