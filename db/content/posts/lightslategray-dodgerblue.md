I wanted to quickly demonstrate what I mean when I say the UI works on both Mobile Devices and Desktop Computers. The first image shows the application in desktop mode, and second on mobile. I cut the mobile up into columns because the image was too long. What happends is that the Desktop version collapses into a single long column on mobile. The application is still usable on mobile. This is not always the case with other applications, people don't always build the layout right.
