I continue working on [news.catpea.com][1] I added categories and little navigational hints, and timestamps.

I want to create a new category, poetry. But I don't want to mix it with quarantine, yet.

So, I guess, the news site will have a category browser with strict rule, one post per category.

And Then I'll add tags, where the user can browse all posts tagged poem for example.
