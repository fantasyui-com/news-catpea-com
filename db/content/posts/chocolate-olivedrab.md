I am testing the other stuff I added now. I narrowed down problems down to one thing so if something is still broken I'll fix it now. I wrote a [cute little program][1] to apply the bug fixes. It is in a language called [Bash][2] ([Bash Tutorial][3]). It is my pet language. Not favorite, but like a bitey pet Lynx type of thing. All my music processing software that I used at the gym was written in Bash. It is an old language.
