[CATPEA DAW][1] is now a Desktop Application, Mobile Devices are too slow for making music, this is a new program with new stuff in it, I won't be changing anything else, I like having all these random gadgets here.

And it is still too early to know if [CATPEA DAW][2] can work, there is no guarantee that what I am doing can actually result in a functional program. I went out of my way to create a Data Structure Driven program with minimal data manipulation functions embedded in the UI only.

A lot of programmers would hate this, the best of them would want me to create well named ACTIONS like 'selectTrack' or 'enableNote' but that just adds to the weight of the program, it destroys it. Programs that are WRITTEN-OUT like the best of these programmers want are BLOATED, HUGE, almost broken by design.

And what I am creating is a program that exploits only that which is possible, and no more. I am creating a self editing data structure with self-updating graphics. If this works out, I'll be able to create programs without programming. It would be more like data shaping and expressing, and not programming. It would beat the heck out of other applications. There is no code here, there is nothing to break.

The trade-off is that a program like this can't receive specific features, UNLESS, they are possible as dictated by the data-structure and its shaping.

If this was a project for a company, for a client and client requested a feature incompatible with the tree, one would have to say "That, is not possible". To rewrite a program like this in standard code with Data Flows, Functions, Actions, Plugins, and such would take years.

Isn't this interesting? Â· Alas, let us first see if I can have all I need to make music withut needing functions.
