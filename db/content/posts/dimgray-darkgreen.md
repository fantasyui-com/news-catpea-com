Github, the company hosting the site, and the site it self is becoming sluggish, so I am opening a new experiment. I am going to add control over loading resources. For example the Shebang Slash soundboard will come with a Start or Load button, the .mp3 samples that it loads will only start loading into the browser when Start/Load is pressed. Â· Eventually I would like to make a website for creating workout music, so stuff like resource control will come in really handy dandy. If CATPEA goes down it is because GitHub broke some promise, I'll be back up within a couple of days.
