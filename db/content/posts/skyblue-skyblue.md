Already bumped into an artifact that deals with integrity problems. Basically when a new part of a song is selected, the stuff that was selected in the old part needs to be cleared. So I created an unselections section in the data file. This is still reasonable, it is not a sign of trouble. But two or three anomalies like that like that could destroy a program like the [CATPEA DAW][1]. But so far so good looks like it will all work.
