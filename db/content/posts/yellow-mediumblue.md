I have added slide-open/slide-closed animation to the drawer in Shebang Slash Beat Sequencer, when opening one of the drawers, instead of contents appearing instantly they slide in vertically. I am not a fan of animation of this kind in GUI world, but everybody seems to be doing it, and if I am to develop a Bootstrap Theme for possible sales, I need to make sure all my designs cooperate nicely with [Svelte's Transition Directives][1].
