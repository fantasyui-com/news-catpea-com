Things in square brackets are supposed to be links, but the system is crashing before I get a chance to replace the square bracket notation, it will take me a moment to figure out why [Sapper][1] is failing. I did finish writing the poem for today, so that's nice. I just found out that on top of everything else [github is having problems][2]: "Update - We are investigating reports of service unavailability."
