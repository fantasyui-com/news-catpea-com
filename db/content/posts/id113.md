I have rebuilt the theme, the third time. This time it follows the programming pattern of [Bootswatch][1].

It feels quite right.

Night more is simple and powerful.

I fixed the big bug that was crashing the site. Github servers won't serve files prefixed with an \_underscore.

Some of my libraries here use that here (not my code) and it is really hard to predict when some program will pull in a library that has files beginning with an underscore.

The overall site is getting sluggish, I may need a real blog program, I will probably run it under blog.catpea.com and probably go craaaaazy with typography.

I updated the [Theme][2] page and it is starting to look pro.

Once I setup blog.catpea.com (in days or few weeks) catpea.com and blog.catpea.com will share the [Theme][3] design.

It will be a great test of usefulness.

Whews.
