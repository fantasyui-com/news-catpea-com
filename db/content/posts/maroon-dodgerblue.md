Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Seven,

Ohh, I waited to write until eleven.

It seems late at night,

but this is when my rhymes take flight.

I admit, I am ready for bed,

but I am just going to sit here, instead,

and wait for my poem to go ahead.

Nuh uhh, rhyming is not always easy,

sometimes you just got to to wait, and take it easy.

Wait for the prime rhyme,

to top of your mind... climb.

And then finally, when you get there,

you sit, read, and stare,

feeling like the poem, is a little bare.

But what can you do? It's late at night,

and you are not really feeling very bright.

But you still have to write,

so that's quite all right.

This is how I begin my night,

I write.
