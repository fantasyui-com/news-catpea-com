My laboratory, is Cat Pea... Oh noes...

Added site-wide support for Night/Day mode. I thought it was a bit hokey at first, but it is solid, it is good, a round of tests will make it perfect.

Chromatic Storytelling Sample

The backgrounds are inspired by Interstellar and Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Take a look at [Chromatic Storytelling][1] to see how they extracted scenes from movies to get a new view of the classics.

In the day mode I use pixels from Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, during the night I use pixels from Interstellar.

The night more is automatically enabled between 8PM and 6AM. I hope 6AM is not too early.

So, of course, there is this crazy little temporal consequence associated with this. When clicking the light-bulb I can't just say it is night or day because the computer is now calculating this.

Now I must ask for allowance, a grace period when I can override the computer's idea a of day.

So when I force night-mode during the day, the computer will reset back after 12 minutes. I think this is funny.

(Oh, and it is 12 minutes, because my Linux monitor goes to sleep after 15, no matter what. So to test the system, it has to be less than 15)

I remember the day, I got my self into all this ridiculousness. People kept saying "Computers are the future", and the little me was like "Hey, I am trying to get my future all sorted out, why don't I learn computers? After all, it is the future!"
