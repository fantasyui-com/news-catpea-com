Captains Log, Star-date Day Eleven. I connected the Beat Sequencer to Sound. Click on any of the tiny boxes and when the loop comes around the sound will fire. Tip: put a drum every four squares, and something that makes a Tsk every other square. Music is really-really simple, like language, music evolved with us, all it takes is sticks and places to hit them with. Actually we don't even need sticks [Tuvan Singing][1]
