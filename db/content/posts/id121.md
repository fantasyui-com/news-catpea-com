I am still getting used to it but it looks pretty neat. I coded the whole thing from scratch, haha.

It reminded me of my days programming [CGI][1] in [Perl][2] I kind of miss that.

I am writing this in my text editor, in the [Markdown][3] format.

That's what I used originally but I wanted to see what would happen is I stored my notes in code. I liked it, but it was not portable across systems.

Too many things change in code, research notes have to be much simpler. And they have to be [readable][4] outside of any programming language.
Github does make this possible, by supporting markdown, I'll just stick with the Markdown format from now on.

I'll probably create a separate repository [for just my posts][5] and do the same for my little book.
