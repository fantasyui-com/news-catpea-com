I am looking over the code, most things that could be done to make the site better are almost impossible due to the restriction that this meeting of technologies imposes.

It is the only way to make things actually work.

The browser was not originally designed for applications. Over last couple of decades it gained technologies that can make applications like CATPEA.

But that meas balancing multiple technologies, and that balance causes severe restrictions in what can go where.

I have worked with numerous technologies developed specifically for making Applications, but they are much worse than the upgraded browser.

This is because nothing has received as much attention as the web. So, even though this technology stack is greatly restricted, it is also very powerful.
