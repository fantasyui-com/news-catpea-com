Day Six of Quarantine: Created a New Autogenerative Music Widget and disguised it as an immature [Sciurine][1] Urine joke. The technology is extremely advanced. I am for the first time in forever connecting virtual synthesizers through a [Reverb Convolver][2]. This reshapes the Synthesized Sounds, the synthesizer waveform, into a more realistic sounding instrument. Reverb just about does it, if Commodore 64 came with a decent reverb it would sound amazing, nothing like chiptunes. I have gotten used to breaking up my Generative Music into movements, and the initial song comes with 24 measures, where evey eight measures I do something interesting with the higher pitched instruments. For the most part I fell like using A Basic [Arpeggiator][3] for everything, I am yet to test it with real world sound samples (digital sound recordings as opposed to synthesizer based sounds.)
