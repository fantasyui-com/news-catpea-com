Added a very early preview of Sound Machine. I aim to create a Workout Song Generator/Builder, but I don't want to just create a Workout Song Generator/Builder and code it. I want to explore areas in and around it, by asking "What are some related programs that take little code to finish?". There is a possibility that Sound Machine can be a useful music Builder/Generator. If you have a Desktop machine take a look at what it would look like as its own page [CATPEA DAW][1] it is a very raw mockup I have the Sound Machine in two places just to see what it would be like to have that little index on the left. Here is a screenshot:
