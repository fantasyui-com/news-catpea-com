I am testing separate [Quarantine][1]/[Research][2] sections in the main menu. The current scroll-bar within a scroll-bar setup was for testing, I wanted to see if it worked or if I needed to so something special. Well, they are both blogs, very similar to the warrior book, they should just have the same UI. This also brings me closer to proper Web Design, where I take a moment to make some fancy graphics to decorate typographical creations.

[1]: /quarantine
