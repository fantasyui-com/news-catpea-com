Another website crash, [Svelte][1] isn't reporting errors properly. Working on it now. I think I know what is going on, but it is just a theory for now. Microsoft is is rolling out github server upgrade, and unusual file-names are causing errors. I got errors from files starting with dot and files starting with underscore. This will fix problems, but I don't know if it is the exact problem I have here, right now.
