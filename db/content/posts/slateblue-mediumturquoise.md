Clarification as to why my development is taking so long. While I am developing some programs that are \*best\* on the desktop. I am actually developing User Interfaces that work on Mobile Phones, and "grow" to fit tablet and desktop. Making user interfaces that work property on Mobile and Desktop is kind of hard, the more detailed they become the harder it is to ensure compatibility.
