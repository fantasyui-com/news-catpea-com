Yah, it is an internal bug I have little to do with, it could be [Rollup][1] or that [Octicons require a json file][2], it is worth solving because it is a learning experience, I get a moment of time to look through the system I am working with, mostly [Svelte][3], [Sapper][4] and [Rollup][5]. The code for [Octicons][6] which is made by github is highly questionable, I should make a copy and just re-write it. There is some [SVG][7] work coming up, since Octicons are in SVG, I may just do that then.
