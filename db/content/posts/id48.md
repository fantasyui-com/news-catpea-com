I've been looking at the submissions in [Bootstrap Expo][1] curated by one of the original [Bootstrap][2] developers. And I feel like the Warrior Book needs better design, and I think maybe the Workout Song Generation may benefit from being its own application. In next few weeks, perhaps, I would like to practice art general design and typography for a bit to create something as beautiful as that [Beautiful Web Type][3] demo.
