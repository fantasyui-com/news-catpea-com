When on Mobile/Tablet (or in a small Desktop Window) Website Navigation collapses and shows an open icon (three lines), now when clicked it will open very smoothly. Previously it just popped into existence (I am not a fan of animations like that, but it tends to be a mark of good programming.)

I continued researching the Navbar issues, and I discovered bootstrap can't make it work without programming. There is no way to transition the menu from height:0pixels (closed) to height:auto (open) because the underlying language does not concern it self with the measurement of what auto actually means. There are no reasonable ways around it. They are stuck using a [big program][1] for it. And by big I mean 433 lines of code.

Let me tell you how many lines my program has.

[ZERO][2] (the three lines are configuration/maintenance not real code)

Woo! No Code

The framework I use comes with the collapsing animation built in.

When I say that [Bootstrap][3] is behind in programming, they are, they really are. [Svelte][4] has a superior animation subsystem, and there is nothing to compare here.

In the morning I felt that [Navbar][5]\-[Svelte][6] integration was problematic, now having taken a closer look, I find their [big program][7] is the problem here.

Bootstrap is currently at version 4.4, they are already making big changes for 5.0. I am not the first to notice that their JavaScript is a problem, they will catch up.
