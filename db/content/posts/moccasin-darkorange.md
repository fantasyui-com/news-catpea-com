[Designer][1] is working out. The tool was needed because of how many tiny adjustments are required to make faux 3D out of mere shadows.

A button in the wild.

[Designer][2] generates ready to go CSS code but that is not what [Bootstrap Themes][3] will want, I have to generate special code that integrates with their color system.

Further more, the button shown above is too big, to anomalous, and can only be used for special occasions.

But, I still need to style default bootstrap buttons.

Default Bootstrap Buttons

So, I have to be a lot more delicate with my design, making only tiny subtle changes. And then the raised 3D button I created are treated as Bonus Extras.

More than writing code, I need to tap into Bootstrap's Module System, their standard library. I need to create a Bootstrap Extended Library, and the functions contained there in, will be injected into Bootstrap's own buttons.

INJECTION IS SIMPLE, in a world where I am dealing with a static program, this is not this world. I am dealing with up to 10 versions of bootstrap ([Bootstrap Versions][4]), so all code modifications on my end must be automated \[serserge\] will take care of it, entirely.

Having said that, that is is about a two year long project, realistically, I may have some neat things, in a few days, but I have to begin programming, for a Team of Developers. I need to put on my manager hat, and begin preparing this Theme project for multiple programmers to help me finish.

This is pretty fun, it is cool.

There is a program called WordPress, they are like a blogging platform. And they support WordPress Themes.

What I need to do, is create a Bootstrap Theme, in such a way, that somebody can plug in my Bootstrap Theme into their own Bootstrap Based WordPress Theme, and it will just work.

It is a lot constraint, restriction, and direction. But pretty fun as well.

So with this post I will launch a third blog (in addition to Poetry and Research) and begin musing about Theme Development. I would like this blog section to be bundled with the theme (or along side it) as a kind of a proof of development, and quality.
