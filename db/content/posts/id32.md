I continue my work on the little Shebang Slash Beat Sequencer, I am searching for an easy UI configuration, that is also fully featured (can edit a huge song), and has a huge area for configuring things beyond Octave and Note. The area that opens up below when user clicks a line number will be used for sound synthesis configuration that could be as many as 10 dropdowns. I don't like horizontal scrolling, this is what this test is about. But there is something wrong with Vertical Scrolling, like here in the [Mod Trackers][1], it just feels too awkward to compose a song downwards. On the other hand I don't want to recreate the [Ableton][2] UI, editing music this way is too slow. I'll probably keep creating these little UI widgets, but begin connecting them together under a common beat. This way the end result is a dashboard of easy to use musical instruments, and probably some fat squirrels.
