I might have come up with a way to toggle night mode on websites, even dark ones. I did this with just two lines of code. Basically what it came down to was asking, "What am I going to do with a red/danger alert box, during night mode?" And the answer is, it had to dark, everything has to be dark in night mode. There cannot be colorful things and especially things with backgrounds.

HUGE BONUS! Applications that are written dark, that look good in dark colors, do not, at all, require dark more. It is simple and logical, but get this: Applications that are Bright, Silver, as most applications are... MUST BE REWRITTEN TO SUPPORT NIGHT MODE. Isn't that unusual. All my work does not need any changes because it is already in dark more.

So, on this website, I don't really need night mode. But, as experimental research goes I do need a system for it. So here is how this will work. This very page, The Research Blog, will be the first one to get night mode, and will be put in dark more by default. Now if somebody wants DAY MODE, then they can switch it off, and the page will become blinding.

I'll work on that for a couple of hours, it shouldn't take long, I already have a demo on the [Theme][1] page.
