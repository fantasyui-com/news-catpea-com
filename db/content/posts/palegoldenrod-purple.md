I continue my GUI Theme development research, today's test is about creating a custom component for the digital workstation. My research revealed that it is more efficient not to use the helper classes I created. By using helper classes such as bg-primary instead of the longer way I end up over-complicating things in the end. I am entering a stage of simplification as I can tell a lot of the things I invented work great. What I would like to see, is as little confusion as possible. If I keep the code simple today, then in a few weeks I can start thinking about selling "Digital Audio Workstation Theme" at [Bootstrap Themes][1], more importantly I get to learn more about Bootstrap's coding conventions, and perhaps make my own Bootstrap even.
