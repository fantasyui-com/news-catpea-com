Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Four.  

I finished a big program, but I am ready for more.  

So, I am writing a poem, and it is always very hard,  
because I never know what its going to be about.  

One moment, I am mighty, serious, and athletic,  
then I sit to the poem, and I lose that aesthetic.  

In my early 20s I wore a Blues Brother suit for office work,  
but even that didn't work, cause I added cowboy-shoes,  
and a huge buckle, not a day past when I didn't get a chuckle.  

Later it got even worse, I wore leather pants and a matrix coat,  
I fit into my coffee shop like a mountain goat.  

Being serious is just too darn hard,  
I don't have the might,  

OK, that's enough for this poetic flight,  
I am done writing, y'all have goodnight.
