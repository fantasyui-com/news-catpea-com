I continued working on [news.catpea.com][1] and actually made very good progress.

I wanted to pull the poems out of code and give them an alternate version that can be easily read via github.

Here is the [result][2], it is not pretty, but it is pretty readable.

Now I can continue with making [news.catpea.com][3] look nicer, I am missing some icons, and i want to allow browsing by category (research/quarantine) so that with a click only poems will come up.
