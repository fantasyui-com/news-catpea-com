Huge problem here is CPU speed. My older phone/tablet can't keep pace, too much CPU processing is required to make music live. Now, there is a way around this, kind of. It should be possible to make a song file and then play it. As far as modern technologies go, CHEAP MOBILE DEVICES are not ready to make music. There is a million ways around this, but each and every one of those comes with drawbacks. This technology works on fast desktops, and that is what I will recommend that people use.
