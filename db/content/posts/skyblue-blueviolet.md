Captain's Log: Day Fifteen of Quarantine,

Squirrels continue being mean.

They just aren't very keen, on the idea,

that their theft gave them diarrhea.

I know not what to do,

Darn Squirrels! that Trailmix was not for you!

Maybe someday we'll move on,

come a sunny day, carry on.

But today, is not that day,

it's just Tuesday.

This is getting out of control,

I don't want to be a poet anymore!

I just wanted to feed the creatures I adore.

Not write strange rhymes out the front door.

I must stop rhyming,

this is not the right timing.

I feel like I've lost control,

spiraling down a Squirrel Hole.

I swear I am not like this in real life... I can change!
