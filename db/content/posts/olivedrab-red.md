Zoinks! I started work on a Graphical Theme for Applications, I called it [Theme][1]. It provides extensions for [Bootstrap][2] and components based on [CATPEA DAW][3]. I'll use it for my research here, and try to keep it tidy and inline with Bootstrap's Programming conventions so that I can think about getting into [Bootstrap Expo][4] and later [Bootstrap Themes][5]. I don't really want to create some stressful situation about sales, tech-support, and bug fixes; but I do like following [Bootstrap][6] conventions (it helps me keep code un-confusing) and I like learning about all this. Here's early: [Theme][7].
