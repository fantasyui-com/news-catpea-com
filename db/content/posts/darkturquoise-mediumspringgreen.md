Yes, I am 99.9% sure that the Sound Machine will work.

The user interface is a lot simpler than [LMMS][1] I could almost call it a SYMBOLIC SEQUENCER because it is so incredibly abstract.

I threw out a lot of ideas that people generally expect from a DAW, I am not even sure I am going to have a Piano Roll in here. What is the use of a piano roll when a typical beat sequencer can be given the most favorite and beautiful chords, it is not like musicians hit all the keys, they just hit that little selection that sounds nice.

The mechanics of a beat sequencer are superior to that of a piano roll, in many contexts. In a majority of related (webbrowser GUI music making) contexts (getting a neat song done quickly, not needing to learn to make music, not needing a real piano to make a song, working with a simple UI, enjoyment of creating music).

I am looking forward to creating a selection of instruments the user can use.

I will create a RANDOMIZE SYNTHESIZER SETTINGS button, this will make different instruments with a simple click of a button. Sure, it is great to have a little library, but is it needed when maybe a selection of 10 synthesizers with a randomize button is available? That makes for hundreds or thousands of instruments just leap out of thin air.
